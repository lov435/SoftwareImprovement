https://stackoverflow.com/a/285187/5749570,@RodneyP.Barbati It's pretty common in Java for lower-arity constructors to call greater-arity constructors and then do nothing else. if a class K has|COMMA| e.g.|COMMA| two final fields a|COMMA| b|COMMA| then the "general constructor" would be K(A a|COMMA| B b) { this.a = a; this.b = b; }.
