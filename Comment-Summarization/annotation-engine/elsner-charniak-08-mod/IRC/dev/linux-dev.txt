7288 Sena :  is there anyway to see what the CPU temperature is ?
7296 Rachel :  Malcolm: use "/etc/fetchmailrc"        -f <pathname> | --fetchmailrc <pathname>

7322 Thurman :  hi, do you have any recommendations for saving videos from a webcam in GNU/Linux?
7335 Rachel :  Malcolm: give yourself a promotion - You decide! ;-)
7341 Malcolm :  Rachel: there are a couple of oblique refs to running as root and that's it.  And if I try to run it as root, it says "running as root is discouraged" and then exits :)

8001 Malcolm :  Rachel / Jesse: should i put the "set daemon" option in /etc/fetchmailrc ? I'm guessing not
8011 Val *  entered the room.
8020 Shenna :  even dmesg says "hda:...."
8025 Shenna :  why is it so?
8029 Elma :  bye folks
8029 Elma :  Shenna: heu... not a damn clue, sorry... but why are using a 2.4 kernel?
8034 Elma *  left the room.
8055 Denny :  Shenna, what are you trying to do?
8060 Shenna :  i am trying toswitch over ti 2.6
8063 Melda :  Elma: maybe because 2.6 still is getting root exploits as development goes on whereas 2.4 hasn't had any in a long time?
8075 Tammi :  hi, i am trying to dump a file system to a dat SCSI tapedrive. if i dump /var partition the speed is 1555KB/S, but if i dump the /home partition i barley get half that speed. Why would this be?
8082 Denny :  Melda, if you stick with around 2.6.12 its all cool

8303 Lizeth :  2.4 limited sata support?
8304 Aldo *  entered the room.
8324 Melda :  Shenna: laptops are sort of odd in that way of sata/scsi/etc

10462 Josef :  I bet otherwise
10469 Josef :  I'd put money on it but I don't think that's very freenode :P
10469 Gale :  German: ok, but each installation is like one more foot in the grave for it due to the dumbest thing every created -- the registry
10485 Paulita :  well if your defending idiots Angla, then your one too.
10490 Paulita :  now leave me be
10492 Margene :  well ok, gamer nerds always trend up on everything, but it's hype, so is directx10
10494 Josef :  Hildegard, it was you who brought the OpenOffice issue to my attention wasn't it?
10504 Winter *  entered the room.
10508 Hildegard :  which issue would that be?

10527 Demetrius *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
10531 German :  Gale, excuse my ignorance, but doesn't gnome have something similar?(never went into the details of it, but gconf looks like the registery)
10532 Margene :  yes, it's a bigger hype than usual
10535 Paulita :  all i did was make a brief statement and now i am suffering with all this grief :D
10540 Josef :  someone else I know put together an email to send them which I helped him with, not sure if he's sent it

10592 Josef :  Hildegard, they're violating the terms of the license and are therefore illegally selling copyrighted material on ebay. should get the account closed, would be nice to see some refunds but I doubt ebay does that.
10612 German :  Gale, my own preference is each program having it's own .(name) directory in $home
10615 Gale :  German: more or less the whole gconf gui registry looking thing in gnome is really just a fancy front end for editing them
10619 Gale :  afaik

10659 Hildegard :  shutting down a powerseller, awesomeness.

12588 Margene :  for example, kget is pretty much the only download manager I've tried that forces resuming on anything, while others fail
12588 Leota :  Jeanice: i tried gensplash so many times and i just gave up
12598 Jeanice :  Leota: what went wrong?
12608 Amber *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
12614 Leota :  Jeanice: compiling it was the easy bit, messing with the startup scripts was where i got stuck
12614 Gale :  yeah, being methodical is a big part
12650 Jeanice :  Leota: ah, personally i don't use the progress bars
12682 Kenya *  entered the room.
12711 Renate :  I'm not a big fan of kget :-\
12719 Renate :  then again, d4x is kinda broken too
12720 Alina *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
12735 Margene :  I've tried them all, kget is the only one that gets it done
12737 Blanche *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
12742 Leota :  Jeanice: well i couldn't get gensplash to compile, i just got errors, and had to install from some deb which completely failed, the error was related to the kernel
12743 Margene :  nothing in gtk2 that's for sure
12747 Sena *  entered the room.
12755 Gertrud *  entered the room.
12766 Gertrud :  ok i have an ext3 image
12776 Renate :  Margene, eh? yea, I haven't found a thing that can compare to flashget/fdm on Windows..
12776 Gertrud :  i did not unmount it cleanly
12782 Renate :  Gertrud, fsck
12784 Gertrud :  is there a way to fsck an image?
12795 Gertrud :  it throws an error when i try to fsck the image
12797 Margene :  archangle25, flashgot/kget works for me every time
12805 Jeanice :  Leota: what distro?
12813 Gertrud :  its not a disk turned into an image, its 30gb of /dev/zero turned into an ext3
12818 Angla :  downthemall works for me
12831 Renate :  Margene, well, I never said it didn't work, I just find it lacking in features
12840 Cristi *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
12840 Rocco *  entered the room.
12841 Renate :  (scripting)
12859 Brande *  left the room (quit: ).
12884 Margene :  well I mean in linux at least, that's the only one that works for me when servers have anti-leech mechanisms

12907 Renate :  Margene, hint, if they don't want you to leech, don't leech
12923 Margene :  no, the problem is they don't just stop leeching, they stop resuming
12933 Hassan *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
12933 Nada *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
12934 Leota :  Jeanice: kubuntu
12938 Hermila *  entered the room.
12949 Arlie :  posting stuff for download, then placing restrictions on downloading it, is against the communist manifesto of the OSS bowel movement
12956 Margene :  I'm sure it's a lot worse to restart a download and suck up even more bandwidth than to resume some multi GB file at 90%
12973 Inez *  entered the room.
12980 Julietta :  can pcap inject packets into a open tcp connection ?
12998 Felicitas *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
13001 Arlie :  pcap injects ethernet packets
13004 Arlie :  so yes
13010 Arlie :  they can be tcp,udp,ip, whatever
13011 Renate :  Margene, wait, if the file is non-resumable how do you resume it? o.O
13022 Jeanice :  Leota: http://jeandamiendurand.free.fr/debian/splashutils/ worked fine for me
13026 Margene :  Renate, I dunno, it just happens
13041 Renate :  magic, zomg! :o.O
13047 Margene :  you send it through flashgot to the downloader again, and it automagically resumes
13083 Julietta :  Arlie, yeah, but don't tcp connections have state information that prevent direct injection like that ?
13110 Leota :  Jeanice: those are the debs i tried, it messed with the entire apt-get install process, it couldn't run the post install process because the ubuntu startup scripts are so different and because the pre-uninstall scripts couldn't also be run the hole thing fell apart
13114 Arlie :  Julietta, you can inject garbage if you want
13119 Sandy *  entered the room.
13123 Arlie :  Julietta, or you can steal someones connection
13123 Clara *  left the room (quit: No route to host).
13149 Ramona *  entered the room.
13150 Arlie :  Julietta, how any 1 particular tcp stack decides to respond to your garabge depends on its implementation
13229 Celsa *  entered the room.
13230 Julietta :  i actually neither want to steal the connection nor i want to inject garbage (data that is not getting accepted by a valid implementation)
13231 Elli :  Hmm
13233 Celsa :  good morning
13236 Gertrud :  hey Renate is there some special option to pass fsck to get it to fsck my ext3 image?
13244 Elli :  Any idea why 'passwd' would ask for a new password four times?
13252 Crista *  entered the room.
13255 Priscila :  Elli: A hacked version.
13261 Melda :  is there a way to get ls -l to print full path in each response?
13265 Arlie :  Julietta, do whatever you want ... its an ethernet packet
13266 Leota :  Jeanice: i had to replace most of the the startup scripts with just echo boo, the problem seemed to be with the kernel not being detected or something
13273 Melda :  so it'll show /home/user/filename.jpg at the end of every single line?
13278 Elli :  Priscila, yeah that could be a possbility except I just recompiled it from sources, thinking just that
13280 Georgeanna *  entered the room.
13282 Melda :  vs just showing filename.jpg?
13284 Elli :  And still the same behavious
13295 Priscila :  Elli: Hmmm. Weird indeed ..
13297 Julietta :  Arlie, well, i can't, to actually inject valid packets i would need to modify the sockets state
13297 Jeanice :  Leota: strange... and what errors did you get when you tried to compile?
13307 Priscila :  Melda: ls -l /home/user/*
13308 Giselle *  left the room.
13308 Elli :  Ya
13360 Priscila :  Elli: I assume you can trust where you gott he sources from?
13371 Arlie :  Julietta, use libpcap to do whatever you want ... your sending ethernet packets ... send valid tcp or dont ... its up to you
13382 Leota :  Jeanice: don't have that info at the moment, this kernel only has the bootsplash patch
13391 Melda :  godlfish: anyway to do that recursively? like with ls -alR to show full paths/permissions on every file in a tree?
13404 Arlinda *  left the room ("Coming Back").

13417 Anneliese *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
13427 Jeanice :  Leota: fair enough
13428 Priscila :  Melda: use find, find /home/user/ -exec ls -l {} +
13433 Elli :  Priscila, yeah
13447 Felicia :  Melda: alias it in your ~/.bashrc
13455 Elli :  Priscila, it might be a PAM module problem actually, hmm
13455 Priscila :  Melda: actually. that will just do the same thing.
13461 Melda :  goldfish: my actual application is a cleint chmod'd "/" to this user... so I want to change EVERYTHING owned by this user on the system to "root:root" and then just fix his homedir
13462 Leota :  Jeanice: bootsplash seemed to be easier to install, i added the bootsplash patch, then used splas bla bla > bootsplash, then extracted my initrd file using cpio and added bootsplash to its top level dir, and then recreated the initrd, that was it, the progress bar didn't matter and it doesn't work, also i made a nice ubuntu theme
13462 Shawnee *  entered the room.
13466 Melda :  rather than reinstalling another system
13471 Priscila :  Elli: Ahhh, I've never used that PAM stuff.
13480 Edith *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
13498 Anya :  How do you keep someone confined to their home directory? I'm having someone ssh'ing in for irssi, but I don't want them to access the rest of my system
13498 Melda :  so i was going to do an ls and grep out his username and then pull the file-paths from like awk '{ print $9 }' from the ls -l and do a | xargs chown root:root, etc
13500 Priscila :  Melda: sounds like you want find...
13501 Felicia :  Elli: and Pam? .. hrm .. sounds nice ;-)
13510 Arlie :  Julietta, ethernet packets dont care what data you put in them ... so long as you have a valid ethernet header with src and dest MAC addresses
13511 Julietta :  Arlie, the point is if you inject data into a open tcp connection, the original application maintaining that connection will recieve a ack for packet it didn't send which will likely result in a broken connection, which means i can't actually inject into a connection, it is NOT up to me
13521 Latrina *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
13527 Priscila :  Melda: find has -user , to find files owned by user, and then has -exec , for executing command on said files.
13532 Julietta :  Arlie, ethernet packets don't but VALID implementations of tcp DO
13540 Jeanice *  left the room (quit: "leaving").
13561 Arlie :  Julietta, of course ... you cant just start pretending to be another application or host, unless you have control over it
13568 Arlie :  Julietta, as in, man-in-the-middle
13574 Julietta :  yeah
13585 Julietta :  well, how would i do that
13589 Julietta :  on application level ?
13597 Priscila :  Melda: so you could do, find / -user user -exec chown root:root {} + , then just fix his home directory.
13599 Julietta :  like grab a handle to another apps socket
13602 Elli :  Felicia, heh =P
13609 Priscila :  Melda: although, do NOT do that actually.
13618 Priscila :  Melda: that will fsck up other things....
13621 Abigail *  entered the room.
13632 Abigail :  does anyone know what they are doing with poppassd?
13634 Arlie :  Julietta, you can send open file descriptors from 1 app to another using message queues and IPC
13653 Felicia :  i smiled or sure ;-)
13659 Felicia :  er for*
13676 Paulita :  http://youtube.com/watch?v=UEOUWQ1Qm5I
13683 Elli :  Felicia, you've got a lively imagination for sure >.<
13684 Arlie :  Julietta, you can also have an app connect to a proxy, and have the proxy connect to wherever the app is supposed to, but it doesnt require libpcap
13687 Shawnee *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
13693 Arlie :  pcap is for capturing packets on the wire
13706 Julietta :  Arlie, is there any way to have that work without doing any modification to the app i want to grab the socket from ?
13717 Arlie :  Julietta, use a proxy
13719 Julietta :  well, except the proxy which i am actually coding right now
13738 Felicia :  these darned red blood cells and hormones keep acting up on me :-)
13743 Elli :  haha
13751 Shawnee *  entered the room.
13762 Arlie :  Julietta, you can also rewrite packets, i think its a feature of iptables
13796 Arlie :  Julietta, you could, in theory, rewrite every outgoing tcp packet to connect to your local proxy instead of where it was going
13803 Arlie :  Julietta, using a userspace iptables filter
13841 Laura *  entered the room.
13842 Julietta :  hmm, yeah

14473 Gale :  Laura: that can happen if say you openned it up again somewhere and edited it but the original occurance was still open
14492 Gale :  Laura: I would check it out first
14502 Felicia :  Lonnie: lspci | grep VGA  for your video card

14566 Gale :  it's going to say that until you rm it iirc
14571 Arlie :  Madison, i thought you were trying to offer an osx virtual host ;)
14571 Gale :  rm the swap file
14578 Madison :  lol
14579 Laura :  okay
14581 Madison :  Arlie: naw
14586 Gale :  but make sure your main one is good first
14588 Gale :  I would
