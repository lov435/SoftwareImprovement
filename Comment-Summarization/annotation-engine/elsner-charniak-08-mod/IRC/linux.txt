4272 Rachel :  there's a high quotient of dumb ones in management....
4276 Katherine :  On a different note, uptime of my PC is very important to me so I was wondering whether if I installed Linux onto a HDD using a spare PC then moved that HDD to my main PC would the linux still work?

6882 Rachel :  Arr!
6891 Hui :  Missy: any rpm based distro and you'd be fine, on ubuntu you'll be stuck with chroot hacks.
6900 Malcolm :  I need to run fetchmail for myself all the time - I can run it as a daemon under my own login and it runs fine, and then survives even if i close my session.  How should I script it to start when the machine boots, so I don't have to rememebr to start it manually?

7060 Rachel :  Malcolm: DAEMON MODE
7060 Rachel :         The --daemon <interval> or -d <interval> option runs fetchmail in daemon mode.  You must specify a numeric argument which is a polling interval in seconds.

7335 Rachel :  Malcolm: give yourself a promotion - You decide! ;-)
7341 Malcolm :  Rachel: there are a couple of oblique refs to running as root and that's it.  And if I try to run it as root, it says "running as root is discouraged" and then exits :)

8055 Denny :  Shenna, what are you trying to do?
8060 Shenna :  i am trying toswitch over ti 2.6
8063 Melda :  Elma: maybe because 2.6 still is getting root exploits as development goes on whereas 2.4 hasn't had any in a long time?
8075 Tammi :  hi, i am trying to dump a file system to a dat SCSI tapedrive. if i dump /var partition the speed is 1555KB/S, but if i dump the /home partition i barley get half that speed. Why would this be?

8303 Lizeth :  2.4 limited sata support?

10382 Paulita :  hosting?
10384 Josef :  they give more if you sign up as a director

10469 Josef :  I'd put money on it but I don't think that's very freenode :P
10469 Gale :  German: ok, but each installation is like one more foot in the grave for it due to the dumbest thing every created -- the registry
10485 Paulita :  well if your defending idiots Angla, then your one too.
10490 Paulita :  now leave me be
10492 Margene :  well ok, gamer nerds always trend up on everything, but it's hype, so is directx10

10527 Demetrius *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
10531 German :  Gale, excuse my ignorance, but doesn't gnome have something similar?(never went into the details of it, but gconf looks like the registery)
10532 Margene :  yes, it's a bigger hype than usual
10535 Paulita :  all i did was make a brief statement and now i am suffering with all this grief :D
10540 Josef :  someone else I know put together an email to send them which I helped him with, not sure if he's sent it
10549 Josef :  gonna go over the legal side with a fine tooth comb tomorrow probably
10551 Hildegard :  Josef: what did you come up with?
10554 Arlie :  Paulita, happens to me all the time ;)

10592 Josef :  Hildegard, they're violating the terms of the license and are therefore illegally selling copyrighted material on ebay. should get the account closed, would be nice to see some refunds but I doubt ebay does that.
10612 German :  Gale, my own preference is each program having it's own .(name) directory in $home
10615 Gale :  German: more or less the whole gconf gui registry looking thing in gnome is really just a fancy front end for editing them
10619 Gale :  afaik
10619 Angla :  http://www.grc.com/stm/shootthemessenger.htm

10659 Hildegard :  shutting down a powerseller, awesomeness.

11798 Priscila :  I wish all those elite "hackers" would stop going for multinational corporations, and take down myspace.
11808 Ruthe :  Angla, im in florida, i know because im talking to someone who is sitting in front of it
11809 Gia :  heh
11816 Cory *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
11821 Margene :  and isn't myspace just a big pedophile ring
11824 Lajuana :  Priscila: why would they want to attack their breeding grounds?~
11839 Priscila :  Lajuana: hackers maybe, not "hackers" !
11843 Paulita :  i figured this was the perfect song to accompany the Mexodus to Amerika :D http://youtube.com/watch?v=8_B1BcDFdQY

11969 Leota *  entered the room.
11974 Leota :  Hi all, anyone know how to mount a usb disk?
11980 Ruthe :  yeah, its a pain, but it doesnt change the fact that plugging the network cable to the box, ifdown ifup the interface
11984 Leota :  my new kernel doesn't have /dev/sh*
11986 Katharina *  entered the room.
11987 Ruthe :  and the box wont get an ip address
11998 Leota :  lsusb shows:  Bus 003 Device 003: ID 08ec:0016 M-Systems Flash Disk Pioneers
12005 Lajuana :  Priscila: well, I figure that real hackers are above such things, crackers are going to go after things that won't cause permanent mental scarring, and script kiddies feel comfortable and at home there.

12041 Ruthe :  Gale, yes
12052 Margene :  script kiddies mostly play with weak botnets ddosing forums
12053 Ruthe :  also reboot
12057 Angla :  is the *other* end of the cable plugged into the computer ?
12058 Ruthe :  just to be on the safe side
12060 Gale :  how about try that with stop and then start instead

12110 Ruthe :  Angla, yes, the person im talking to has plugged the cable to the computer before
12127 Ruthe :  so at least Im sure he knows how to do that much
12130 Angla :  is there another cable to try ?
12141 Gale :  has he plugged in a power cable before though?
12152 Ruthe :  there is, but why would that same cable work on a different box?
12156 Albertine *  is starting to hate his custom kernel
12169 Leota :  but i do love kde 3.5.7 :D
12189 Ruthe :  Gale, he is reading to me what he sees on the screen, system is on
12193 Angla :  Ruthe, trying as many possibilities as possible. it's *bound* to be something simple
12209 Andy *  left the room (quit: Excess Flood).

12276 Gale :  Ruthe: did you make sure the network module is loaded?
12281 Andy *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
12281 Leota :  Renate: you get custom text colour for kicker, so you can have a black background in kicker with nice white text or whatever colour you want
12295 Renate :  oh... meh, guess it's nothing new then
12299 Leota :  and lots more... but kicker is the awesome bit
12338 Margene :  the kicker is the kicker
12342 Justine *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
12348 Angla :  Ruthe, if i were you, i'd make a list of possible reasons why. and then systematically try them out. i wouldn't go assuming anything
12350 Andrew *  entered the room.
12377 Jeanice :  you need a custom kernel for kde?
12377 Gale :  yeah, it's the assumptions that lead to nowhere
12397 Gale :  best thing to do is start with the simple and easy to overlook stuff and work your way up
12397 Leota :  Jeanice: no the stock kernel is fine
12417 Fernando *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
12418 Leota :  Jeanice: i just wanted to add stuff like bootsplash, ubuntu's usplash sucks
12425 Margene :  I'll just wait for kde 4
12427 Leota :  and i wanted initng
12429 Fernando *  entered the room.
12432 Leota :  Margene: long wait then...
12434 Margene :  till then I'll stick w/ xfce
12435 Angla :  the assumption that linux just decided to not work, is the least likely, by far
12439 Renate :  KDE4 is vaporware...
12445 Jeanice :  Leota: ah i see, sorry, i thought you made a custom kernel for kde. may i recommend gensplash btw
12458 Blanche *  entered the room.
12463 Margene :  indeed it is, but 3.5 just doesn't cut it for me
12463 Santo :  Margene: why would you go from XFCE to KDE bloatware?  Unless KDE4 will not be bloatware any longer...
12476 Margene :  Santo, not go, but try it out
12480 Christina *  entered the room.
12481 Santo :  ah
12495 Sena *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
12499 Gale :  Angla: or like I always say, "
12511 Angla :  ?
12512 Margene :  the only thing is there's a lot of qt apps that are really great
12513 Gale :  When it comes to troubleshooting, educated guesses are good, assumptions aren't
12523 Christina :  I have a question.  I need to know the kernel parameter to use to tell an ubuntu install where the CD media is located at over a PXE server.
12537 Delmar :  has anyone used  Xcircuit ?  is that an app to draw and to test circiuts if theu work ?
12562 Cyndy *  entered the room.
12568 Cyndy *  left the room.
12571 Angla :  Gale, a calm methodical approach to narrowing the search space, then you shoot the dog that chewed the cable ...

12577 Lizbeth *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
12578 Cyndy *  left the room.
12588 Margene :  for example, kget is pretty much the only download manager I've tried that forces resuming on anything, while others fail
12588 Leota :  Jeanice: i tried gensplash so many times and i just gave up
12598 Jeanice :  Leota: what went wrong?
12608 Amber *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
12614 Leota :  Jeanice: compiling it was the easy bit, messing with the startup scripts was where i got stuck
12614 Gale :  yeah, being methodical is a big part
12650 Jeanice :  Leota: ah, personally i don't use the progress bars
12682 Kenya *  entered the room.
12711 Renate :  I'm not a big fan of kget :-\
12719 Renate :  then again, d4x is kinda broken too
12720 Alina *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
12735 Margene :  I've tried them all, kget is the only one that gets it done
12737 Blanche *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
12742 Leota :  Jeanice: well i couldn't get gensplash to compile, i just got errors, and had to install from some deb which completely failed, the error was related to the kernel
12743 Margene :  nothing in gtk2 that's for sure
12747 Sena *  entered the room.
12755 Gertrud *  entered the room.
12766 Gertrud :  ok i have an ext3 image
12776 Renate :  Margene, eh? yea, I haven't found a thing that can compare to flashget/fdm on Windows..
12776 Gertrud :  i did not unmount it cleanly
12782 Renate :  Gertrud, fsck
12784 Gertrud :  is there a way to fsck an image?
12795 Gertrud :  it throws an error when i try to fsck the image
12797 Margene :  archangle25, flashgot/kget works for me every time
12805 Jeanice :  Leota: what distro?
12813 Gertrud :  its not a disk turned into an image, its 30gb of /dev/zero turned into an ext3
12818 Angla :  downthemall works for me
12831 Renate :  Margene, well, I never said it didn't work, I just find it lacking in features
12840 Cristi *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
12840 Rocco *  entered the room.
12841 Renate :  (scripting)
12859 Brande *  left the room (quit: ).
12884 Margene :  well I mean in linux at least, that's the only one that works for me when servers have anti-leech mechanisms

12907 Renate :  Margene, hint, if they don't want you to leech, don't leech
12923 Margene :  no, the problem is they don't just stop leeching, they stop resuming
12933 Hassan *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

12934 Leota :  Jeanice: kubuntu
12938 Hermila *  entered the room.
12949 Arlie :  posting stuff for download, then placing restrictions on downloading it, is against the communist manifesto of the OSS bowel movement
12956 Margene :  I'm sure it's a lot worse to restart a download and suck up even more bandwidth than to resume some multi GB file at 90%
12973 Inez *  entered the room.
12980 Julietta :  can pcap inject packets into a open tcp connection ?
12998 Felicitas *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
13001 Arlie :  pcap injects ethernet packets
13004 Arlie :  so yes
13010 Arlie :  they can be tcp,udp,ip, whatever
13011 Renate :  Margene, wait, if the file is non-resumable how do you resume it? o.O
13022 Jeanice :  Leota: http://jeandamiendurand.free.fr/debian/splashutils/ worked fine for me
13026 Margene :  Renate, I dunno, it just happens
13041 Renate :  magic, zomg! :o.O
13047 Margene :  you send it through flashgot to the downloader again, and it automagically resumes
13083 Julietta :  Arlie, yeah, but don't tcp connections have state information that prevent direct injection like that ?
13110 Leota :  Jeanice: those are the debs i tried, it messed with the entire apt-get install process, it couldn't run the post install process because the ubuntu startup scripts are so different and because the pre-uninstall scripts couldn't also be run the hole thing fell apart
13114 Arlie :  Julietta, you can inject garbage if you want
13119 Sandy *  entered the room.
13123 Arlie :  Julietta, or you can steal someones connection
13123 Clara *  left the room (quit: No route to host).
13149 Ramona *  entered the room.
13150 Arlie :  Julietta, how any 1 particular tcp stack decides to respond to your garabge depends on its implementation
13229 Celsa *  entered the room.
13230 Julietta :  i actually neither want to steal the connection nor i want to inject garbage (data that is not getting accepted by a valid implementation)
13231 Elli :  Hmm
13233 Celsa :  good morning
13236 Gertrud :  hey Renate is there some special option to pass fsck to get it to fsck my ext3 image?
13244 Elli :  Any idea why 'passwd' would ask for a new password four times?
13252 Crista *  entered the room.
13255 Priscila :  Elli: A hacked version.
13261 Melda :  is there a way to get ls -l to print full path in each response?
13265 Arlie :  Julietta, do whatever you want ... its an ethernet packet
13266 Leota :  Jeanice: i had to replace most of the the startup scripts with just echo boo, the problem seemed to be with the kernel not being detected or something
13273 Melda :  so it'll show /home/user/filename.jpg at the end of every single line?
13278 Elli :  Priscila, yeah that could be a possbility except I just recompiled it from sources, thinking just that
13280 Georgeanna *  entered the room.
13282 Melda :  vs just showing filename.jpg?
13284 Elli :  And still the same behavious
13295 Priscila :  Elli: Hmmm. Weird indeed ..
13297 Julietta :  Arlie, well, i can't, to actually inject valid packets i would need to modify the sockets state
13297 Jeanice :  Leota: strange... and what errors did you get when you tried to compile?
13307 Priscila :  Melda: ls -l /home/user/*
13308 Giselle *  left the room.
13308 Elli :  Ya
13360 Priscila :  Elli: I assume you can trust where you gott he sources from?
13371 Arlie :  Julietta, use libpcap to do whatever you want ... your sending ethernet packets ... send valid tcp or dont ... its up to you
13382 Leota :  Jeanice: don't have that info at the moment, this kernel only has the bootsplash patch
13391 Melda :  godlfish: anyway to do that recursively? like with ls -alR to show full paths/permissions on every file in a tree?
13404 Arlinda *  left the room ("Coming Back").

13417 Anneliese *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
13427 Jeanice :  Leota: fair enough
13428 Priscila :  Melda: use find, find /home/user/ -exec ls -l {} +
13433 Elli :  Priscila, yeah
13447 Felicia :  Melda: alias it in your ~/.bashrc
13455 Elli :  Priscila, it might be a PAM module problem actually, hmm
13455 Priscila :  Melda: actually. that will just do the same thing.
13461 Melda :  goldfish: my actual application is a cleint chmod'd "/" to this user... so I want to change EVERYTHING owned by this user on the system to "root:root" and then just fix his homedir
13462 Leota :  Jeanice: bootsplash seemed to be easier to install, i added the bootsplash patch, then used splas bla bla > bootsplash, then extracted my initrd file using cpio and added bootsplash to its top level dir, and then recreated the initrd, that was it, the progress bar didn't matter and it doesn't work, also i made a nice ubuntu theme
13462 Shawnee *  entered the room.
13466 Melda :  rather than reinstalling another system
13471 Priscila :  Elli: Ahhh, I've never used that PAM stuff.
13480 Edith *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
13498 Anya :  How do you keep someone confined to their home directory? I'm having someone ssh'ing in for irssi, but I don't want them to access the rest of my system
13498 Melda :  so i was going to do an ls and grep out his username and then pull the file-paths from like awk '{ print $9 }' from the ls -l and do a | xargs chown root:root, etc
13500 Priscila :  Melda: sounds like you want find...
13501 Felicia :  Elli: and Pam? .. hrm .. sounds nice ;-)
13510 Arlie :  Julietta, ethernet packets dont care what data you put in them ... so long as you have a valid ethernet header with src and dest MAC addresses
13511 Julietta :  Arlie, the point is if you inject data into a open tcp connection, the original application maintaining that connection will recieve a ack for packet it didn't send which will likely result in a broken connection, which means i can't actually inject into a connection, it is NOT up to me
13521 Latrina *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
13527 Priscila :  Melda: find has -user , to find files owned by user, and then has -exec , for executing command on said files.
13532 Julietta :  Arlie, ethernet packets don't but VALID implementations of tcp DO
13540 Jeanice *  left the room (quit: "leaving").
13561 Arlie :  Julietta, of course ... you cant just start pretending to be another application or host, unless you have control over it
13568 Arlie :  Julietta, as in, man-in-the-middle
13574 Julietta :  yeah
13585 Julietta :  well, how would i do that
13589 Julietta :  on application level ?
13597 Priscila :  Melda: so you could do, find / -user user -exec chown root:root {} + , then just fix his home directory.
13599 Julietta :  like grab a handle to another apps socket
13602 Elli :  Felicia, heh =P
13609 Priscila :  Melda: although, do NOT do that actually.
13618 Priscila :  Melda: that will fsck up other things....
13621 Abigail *  entered the room.
13632 Abigail :  does anyone know what they are doing with poppassd?
13634 Arlie :  Julietta, you can send open file descriptors from 1 app to another using message queues and IPC
13653 Felicia :  i smiled or sure ;-)
13659 Felicia :  er for*
13676 Paulita :  http://youtube.com/watch?v=UEOUWQ1Qm5I
13683 Elli :  Felicia, you've got a lively imagination for sure >.<
13684 Arlie :  Julietta, you can also have an app connect to a proxy, and have the proxy connect to wherever the app is supposed to, but it doesnt require libpcap
13687 Shawnee *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
13693 Arlie :  pcap is for capturing packets on the wire
13706 Julietta :  Arlie, is there any way to have that work without doing any modification to the app i want to grab the socket from ?
13717 Arlie :  Julietta, use a proxy
13719 Julietta :  well, except the proxy which i am actually coding right now
13738 Felicia :  these darned red blood cells and hormones keep acting up on me :-)
13743 Elli :  haha
13751 Shawnee *  entered the room.
13762 Arlie :  Julietta, you can also rewrite packets, i think its a feature of iptables
13796 Arlie :  Julietta, you could, in theory, rewrite every outgoing tcp packet to connect to your local proxy instead of where it was going
13803 Arlie :  Julietta, using a userspace iptables filter
13841 Laura *  entered the room.
13842 Julietta :  hmm, yeah

14920 Gale :  vi isn't as flexible
14935 Alma *  entered the room.
14939 Gale :  Ruthe: what was it>?
14940 Cordia :  `abo - you are going to get different responces from different people so i usualy suggest checking distrowatch.com for a description of each OS
14956 Laura :  Gale: but when I do %s/bEnabled it replaces bEnabled by empty string
14971 Gale :  Laura: you need more than that
14982 Ruthe :  Gale, cable modem  learns the mac addr of the last box it handled the dhcp request for
14987 Carey *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

15018 Ruthe :  modem needs to be turned off for a few seconds

15153 Nestor :  i've tried kill PID and kill -TERM PID an the proccess is still there unaffected
15155 Ruthe :  Gale, yeah you were right, my stupidity was resetting it while it was connected to the xp box
15156 Laura :  Gale: thanks :) All worked
15158 Jeanna :  Nestor
15162 Jeanna :  ttry kill -9 pid
15162 Margene :  send a cyborg back in time to kill the process' mother
15164 Ruthe :  so it would relearn the xp mac
15171 Jeanna :  -9 sends the kill signal
15171 Laura :  Now I gotta figure out unreal tournament itself WebServer Entry.WebServer0 (Function UWeb.WebServer.BeginPlay:01ED) BindPort: bind failed
15175 Laura :  heh
15176 Jeanna :  but you should always send SIGTERM first
15190 Gale :  Ruthe: it also may have required being fully powered down for 10 or so seconds
15196 Jeanna :  Laura, ever chat on msn chat?
15200 Elli :  I hate how one miss-typed char in one single config file can mess things up so badly

15318 Jeanna :  sarah, i didn't know the kill command supported regex
15322 Nestor :  Elli: ok.

18380 Lai :  Azzie:  i am truly grateful for the effort; but i cant see how i'd get the money out of paypal?
18386 Arlie :  Lai, if you ever get a computer and an isp again, by all means, setup a website and start selling vitamins or something ... you have the skills to do it, you just keep thinking you dont need money
18399 Lai :  lol remind me of that one
18408 Azzie :  Lai: You do need a bank account, but there shouldnt be any reason you couldnt have one?
18419 Arlie :  selling vitamins is a worthy profession ... people need vitamins

18498 Lai :  i still think a $15 or $20 debit cards would be a better idear
18504 Delmar :  has anyone used pcb ?
18509 Lai :  Angla: be well
18523 Arlie :  Azzie, yes, even a simple checking account requires that you didnt screw up your last checking account, which is easy to do if you have no money
18529 Lai :  or plain money orders
18540 Alana *  left the room.

18574 Lai :  i give you the mailing address of where to send them- to the manager of property
18574 Josephina :  Gigi: no relationship, they do the same sort of thing, but are different in several ways. I recommend mingw+msys but have used cygwin and got no problem with it
18577 Angelika :  that user is anybody???

18634 Vashti *  left the room (quit: Read error: 145 (Connection timed out)).
18641 Lashawna :  what are the chances a 16 year old sophomore who's been programming since 10 can a job with google?
18644 Mirta :  what's up sir?
18646 Lai :  Alisa: heh
18660 Arlie :  Lai, get busy designing a website to accept hurricane relief donations and pay yourself a percentage as a salary ... hurricane season is starting again

18665 Virgina *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
18669 Ricardo :  Alisa: hehe, what's up? I'm just here trying to figure out how the hell I can try to send commands into a program listening on the parallel com port
18675 Alisa :  Lashawna: as a 16 year old Junior also lusting for a job at google, I think you've got better chances than I, at very least.
18681 Mirta :  Hey - dude - I like got a job interview tomorrow finally.
18691 Lai :  cool
18701 Josephina :  Ricardo: I thought com port was serial
18707 Alisa :  Ricardo: nothing too important...just celebrating the return of Lai :`)
18708 Lashawna :  Mirta, but how old r u
18717 Mirta :  34
18719 Lashawna :  Mirta, and do you have a degree?
18721 Arlie :  sure, work at google, just dont take stock options in leiu of salary
18724 Lai :  heh
18726 Mirta :  2 years.
18741 Azzie :  Lashawna: Im a 19 year old coder who has been coding sine at least 10 and am in the same position.
18746 Arlie :  at $460 a share for a company that has yet to make $1 in profit ... its not a good deal
18755 Lai :  heh
18758 Ricardo :  Josephina: you know, I think you're right, but it doesn't matter for what I'm trying to do, but it is serial, I'm just retarded lol
18768 Lai :  ok, so where are we on the relif?
18771 Sara *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
18774 Azzie :  Lashawna: The key with that company is to do get a good degree and do something big in school.
18776 Josephina :  Ricardo: hehe ok
18778 Azzie :  from what i hear..
18779 Lai :  should i post a mialing address to send it to?
18786 Alisa :  !seen Kacy
18795 Lai :  this would be a one shot thing tho cuz i cant rejoin later to remind
18796 Nicki :  Lashawna: Here's a hint.  Don't go around telling people you've been programming since 10.  (yes, I know it's likely literally true.  But it shows immaturity to claim it the same way professional programmers cite their years of experience.))
18799 Malcom *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
18801 Josephina :  Ricardo: and linux doesn't call it a com port, it's called a serial tty or something
18806 Mirta :  Lashawna - who are you and why does it matter so much? People who know me know that this is a step forward.
18837 Lashawna :  I'm just tired of working for myself
18839 Shayna *  entered the room.
18842 Alisa :  Lai: yeah. Post it. I'll see if we can get Kacy to put it in the /topic :)))
18843 Arlie :  Lashawna, no, screw that, if your good, let everyone know it, except your co-workers
18845 Josephina :  Ricardo: and how to make a program think it's receiving data from it, would depend on how the program is receiving data from it
18846 Ricardo :  Josephina: ah thanks for the heads up
18847 Felicia :  Lai: sure . can't hurt .. or open a temp new channel and let everyone interested join .. then take it from there
18861 Laraine *  entered the room.
18865 Ricardo :  Josephina: yeah, it's using some library to do it, guess I need to figure out how that library works
18866 Felicia :  Lai: open a channel called #Lai ;-)
18866 Lashawna :  Arlie, my brother told me that one?
18872 Josephina :  Ricardo: ah ok
18874 Lai :  ok; but someone else is gonna have to remind others
18889 Felicia :  Lai: oh .. whatever then
18889 Azzie :  Someone make a quizrelief bot
18894 Alice *  entered the room.
18895 Arlie :  Lashawna, co-workers are evil ... they'll screw you up if your good enough to make them look bad .... they operate based on fear
18899 Mirta :  hello Azzie
18900 Ricardo :  I am half way done with a 4 year degree and working with a company designing software for night vision cameras, co-op programs rock
18901 Mable *  entered the room.
18908 Lai :  what whatever?
18908 Lai :  huh?
18909 Nicki :  Arlie: only at crappy places. :)
18911 Azzie :  Ricardo: Hello there, how is it going?
18919 Arlie :  Nicki, it happens everywhere
18922 Felicia :  Lai: i figured to keep it a bit erm private
18927 Lashawna :  Arlie, that's interesting
18928 Nicki :  Arlie: cynic. :)
18931 Arlie :  Nicki, at least, anywhere were there is a gap in skill levels
18938 Arlie :  its human nature
18939 Ricardo :  Azzie: pretty good, just at the office, about to leave
18943 Ricardo :  how are you?
18954 Lai :  Felicia: ok i'm bumming here; fizzle
18966 Felicia :  Lai: if everyone needs to mail to that address on their own then maybe it';s beetter you spm it and it get's spammed ;-P
18970 Azzie :  Ricardo: Well, end of semester work, what could be better?
18973 Angelika *  left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
18978 Nicki :  Arlie: well, I've never been "screwed up" by a junior programmer.  they come to me for help.
18980 Josephina :  Ricardo: if it's just reading from /dev/ttyS0 or something you could somehow get it to just read from a named pipe instead
18999 Arlie :  Nicki, no no no ... someone below you is not a co-worker, they are an underling
19003 Lai :  Felicia:  ok then what?
19006 Ricardo :  Azzie: I hate that crap... you in college?
19007 Lashawna :  ok, so my chances with google are probably slim, does anyone know of a company in need of experienced html, css, jscript, perl, python, etc. programmers?
19016 Nicki :  Arlie: the sr programmers come to me for help, also. :)
19032 Lashawna :  Nicki, then you should get promoted
19034 Ricardo :  Josephina: hmm yeah maybe you're right... I might just have to end up modifying the entire program
19035 Arlie :  Nicki, yes, but them comming to you, and you making them look bad, are 2 different issues
19041 Katherin *  entered the room.
19043 Felicia :  Lai: post the info .. atleast it'll be logged soemwhere then .. i didn't know what/who's address you were going to throw out
19044 Izetta *  left the room (quit: Nick collision from services.).
19044 Tena *  entered the room.
19045 Katherin *  left the room (quit: Excess Flood).
19045 Ricardo :  just to read from a different input stream
19055 Azzie :  Ricardo: Indeed, trying to decide if im going to keep putting up with this or just start coding for myself.
19056 Tena :  hey, anyone know if theres any way i can play songs i bought on itunes in linux?
19061 Izetta *  entered the room.
19074 Azzie :  Tena: No, and thats what you get for buying from ITunes.
19078 Ricardo :  finish college at least, how many more years you have?
19087 Lai :  Felicia: the address to -- you know what, i think it's not such a good idear
19094 Azzie :  Ricardo: 3 at least.
19097 Ricardo :  Tena: you just need to get the m4a/mp4 plugin
19098 Maegan *  left the room (quit: "I'm leaving.").

19117 Nicki :  Lashawna: I'm paid well.  I don't care about job titles.  and I enjoy troubleshooting for others. :)
19124 Azzie :  Ricardo: I would rather be coding!
19129 Dagny *  entered the room.
19134 Felicia :  Lai: or PM one of us .. or whatever ..
19135 Ricardo :  Azzie: there is a lot of coding to be done in college lol
19137 Lai :  crap
19139 Arlie :  Lai, i feel for you, but im not sending you any money
19144 Lai :  k
19161 Alisa :  Lashawna: look on jobs.com, also jobs.perl.com.
19163 Ricardo :  Azzie: get on some open source projects like KDE or gaim or gcc or something
19164 Felicia :  so what .. that's just one monkey Q
19165 Azzie :  Ricardo: Either that, or transfer to a school where I can find a teacher who is as interested in independent coding projects as I am.
19184 Felicia :  there's many more of us apes about
19189 Dorthy :  the interesting CS classes don't start until your junior/senior year, especially if you're already familiar with the languages being taught and basic data structure concepts
19194 Arlie :  Felicia, hey man, i was homeless and noone sent me any money
19201 Horacio *  entered the room.
19208 Ricardo :  Dorthy: true.. I am going into my third year, finally get to do AI and OS and compilers, etc
19209 Azzie :  Ricardo: I'm trying, but the problem is that I have to spend far too much time on schoolwork, even though im paying 30k/year for it.
19211 Lai :  Arlie: did you ask?
19212 Cornelius *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
19215 Arlie :  Lai, no
19223 Lai :  ok then
19232 Dagny :  How can I discover which library file(s) contain an exported function name? I'm having a problem with linking against libpci.a and gzopen, and thinking another library may have declared the names
19232 Azzie :  classic
19234 Arlie :  Lai, if you have a truck load of stuff, why dont you sell it
19250 Ricardo :  Azzie: hehe but it's only 3 more years... that's really short when you think abou tit.. I'd say just bear through it and get your degree, it's going to make it a lot easier to find a job and you'll get paid more
19251 Lai :  i dont have access to my stuff atm
19254 Arlie :  Lai, then when your out of stuff, find a south bound train and jump on it
19260 Alisa :  Azzie: hah, the CS professors at the local university are A.) A man with a degree in parsing, not teaching CS, and B.)A woman who is a MAJOR microserf.
19260 Nicki :  Dagny: strings and grep? ;)
19269 Lai :  Arlie: yea or bus
19270 Arlie :  Lai, wheres all your stuff ?
19282 Lai :  Arlie: in the apt i was evicted from

19289 Na *  entered the room.
19290 Arlie :  Lai, go get it
19290 Daphne *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
19290 Dagny :  Is that it? With having ldconfig I thought there must be a location for the list of exported functions
19307 Ricardo :  Lai: why'd you get evicted? I missed the first half of this conversation
19316 Daphne *  entered the room.
19323 Azzie :  Alisa: Luckilly at my school there are no microserfs :-).  We all have to do our coding with gcc.  The problem is most the profs just teach as a side job so they have their hands more than full.
19329 Ricardo :  Josephina: lol I think it'd be much easier if I just modified the program....
19334 Lai :  Ricardo: alledged non-payment of rent
19336 Ricardo :  so I'm going to do taht
19337 Cedrick *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
19341 Nicki :  Dagny: or grepping the source code or the documentation of the apis
19347 Arlie :  Lai, you mean, payment of rent with junk bonds ?

19359 Virgina *  entered the room.

21582 Santo :  hmm.. no reason for me to spend $500 to be an official citizen when i have nothing to gain.  and the paperwork and bureaucracy is a bitch.

21606 Jesse :  Felicia: gratifyingly, it's widening...
21613 Madison :  my mother used to work at a government office
21617 Madison :  they can still deport you
21617 Santo :  Arlie: you should be exported
21625 Madison :  citizenship you have rights
21625 Santo :  Madison: why would they deport me?
21626 Arlie :  Santo, yes, im in demand
21635 Santo :  Arlie: moving to brazil, you said?

21651 Arlie :  Santo, i never said that
21653 Regine *  sacrifices some dumbasses to the almighty Mid-Atlantic Ridge ;-)
21656 Madison :  i am a legal brazillian citizen too
21659 Arlie :  Santo, well if your here legally, no worries
21663 Santo :  Arlie: :)
21673 Nilsa *  entered the room.
21677 Madison :  but not being a citizen does not give you certain protections
21681 Santo :  i know
21692 Arlie :  Madison, he doesnt have to be a citizen if he doesnt want to be
21692 Madison :  and i would never want to go back to romainia
21693 Santo :  but it saves me $500 and lots of trip to the government building downtown
21693 Florrie :  arping -I eth0 00:AA:...      returns "unknown host" Can I arping my local computer using my NIC cards MAC address?
21710 Arlie :  Madison, so long as his visa is valid and he's here legally
21721 Madison :  Arlie: i was talking on his sake not mine
21732 Madison :  i have een people get deported that thought this same thing
21746 Santo :  Madison: what were they deported for?
21756 Madison :  said fuck it i aint paying for another visa
21763 Jesse :  Felicia: hurling them into volcanos is a noble tradition ;)
21769 Arlie :  they just busted a prostitution slavery ring in minneapolis yesterday, and the local police are still saying illegal aliens arent anything they care to enforce
21772 Chau *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
21779 Santo :  You guys don't seem to understand there's something called a "Permanent Resident Alien"
21785 Gloria *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
21797 Arlie :  something like 17 of the 18 people bustered were illegal aliens, and all the hoes were as well
21797 Madison :  i understand completely
21811 Madison :  Santo: but shit that deals with marriage  n shit
21813 Santo :  Minneapolis hoes?  Doesn't sound appealing.
21817 Madison :  doesnt apply the same
21826 Ima *  entered the room.
21831 Ruthe *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
21839 Santo :  I'll think of marriage in due time.  Not now.
21850 Arlie :  im just saying, its damn sad when the police department enables that sort of thing, by not caring if people are illegals or not
21852 Madison :  2ndly many people dream to become a citizen and you turn it down
21866 Reggie *  entered the room.
21866 Arlie :  Madison, its a big world man, thats his right
21868 Santo :  Madison: no, many people care to come live in America
21883 Madison :  huh?
21885 Arlie :  Madison, so long as he's here legally thats fine ... he's accounted for
21891 Jamar *  entered the room.
21893 Santo :  errerererererer
21895 Madison :  Arlie: half way ;)
21904 Santo :  attention slowly drifting from irc to what i'm supposed to be doing
21905 Santo :  later

21921 Arlie :  Madison, if i got a job offer to go work in the UK for 6 months ... wtf do i want to deal with becomming a UK citizen ... im just there to work
21923 Madison :  thieves liaers and prostitutes
21936 Madison :  Arlie: thats different - hes been here for 10 years ;)
21938 Arlie :  Madison, thats what work visas are for
21950 Arlie :  Madison, if they keep extending his visa, thats fine
21955 Madison :  i guesss
21957 Lizbeth *  entered the room.
21957 Santo :  my vissa doesn't expire
21962 Madison :  still marriage rules
21963 Margarette :  anyone know the name of a command line program for encryption of text files?
21965 Arlie :  Madison, but 10 years, i would say, he's not telling the whole truth
21967 Hallie *  entered the room.
21970 Santo :  haha
21981 Madison :  lol
21987 Priscila :  Margarette: rot13
21993 Arlie :  because its proven that millions and millions of people here have expired visas and the worse they get is a fine, if even that
21993 Margarette :  thanks
22003 Madison :  Arlie: yea
22012 Madison :  in the 50;'s tey would have been thrown out
22013 Santo :  Arlie: i came here on a permanent visa
22028 Hilde *  entered the room.
22032 Arlie :  Santo, if you say so ... i cant claim to be an expert on legal immigration, since i was born here
22044 Madison :  Arlie: thankfully ;)
22058 Adria *  entered the room.
22065 Arlie :  Santo, im just completely and utterly disgusted at the fact that noone does anything about the illegal immigration problem ... bunch of assholes running the country
22076 Madison :  i used ot be like oh man why did my grand mother and grandfather come from france it would be so cool to still be there and see it
22080 Santo :  Arlie: duh.  america is a joke.  look at bush/all the corrupt politicans
22095 Margarette :  Priscila: something thats abit more secure perhaps?
22104 Arlie :  well, i wouldnt say "america" is a joke, just the current crop of people running it
22110 Madison :  Santo: dont get cocky ..........ive been to romiania remember
22120 Santo :  Madison: did i say romania is better than america?
22121 Arlie :  america is the land, the political system is whats messed up
22136 Madison :  political system is fine ........give it 2 years
22142 Madison :  it happens
22145 Santo :  Arlie: america as a political entity has made disastrous decisions in the past few years and now is disliked by the majority of the world
22149 Madison :  carter almost destoyred the country
22159 Arlie :  i told Madison my grand simplified scheme for fixing all of it ... make it illegal for politicians to give speeches written by someone else
22159 Madison :  lol
22165 Priscila :  Margarette: :), gpg maybe?
22165 Madison :  who ever liked america ?????? lol
22169 Santo :  Arlie: that is a really good idea
22171 Madison :  in france they hat america
22177 Madison :  but it would be sure great to come here
22179 Arlie :  Santo, yeah, well, we got attacked, people panick when they get attacked ... its normal human behavior
22187 Margarette :  Priscila: lol, thanks
22194 Arlie :  Santo, it'll die down and pass
22200 Santo :  Arlie: the government is not supposed to panick
22213 Madison :  omg
22216 Arlie :  Santo, well, the muslims nutjobs crashed airplanes into the pentagon ... its understandable
22216 Madison :  stop politics
22223 Madison :  esp from a eastern european
22224 Santo :  Arlie: did you read that story about the plan to keep troops in Iraq for the next few decades?
22228 Madison :  can you even vote ????//
22240 Arlie :  i mean, come on ... lets all jump in a plane and slam it into the kremlin and see if the soviets dont mobilize
22244 Sherlene *  entered the room.
22247 Madison :  Arlie: lol
22252 Priscila :  It was staged. The US did it.
22258 Arlie :  or just go outside and poke your finger in an ant hill, tell me you dont get bit
22269 Madison :  Priscila: keeping beliving it
22277 Santo :  Yes, it made PERFECT sense to attack Afghanistan.
22283 Priscila :  Madison: Okay.
22288 Arlie :  Santo, i dont agree with troops being anywhere ... its stupid
22300 Sherlene :  Hey can anyone give me a link to more about Linux packaging. I want to package my software for .deb and rpms
22303 Arlie :  Santo, except in actual defense of the nations security, and i dont think that should include oil
22304 Santo :  That's the extent of America's foreign policy since 2000.  "Send troops here, get oil."
22327 Billi *  entered the room.
22327 Madison :  stop dude
22337 Madison :  stop the politics
22348 Jesse :  Sherlene: d.o has info about creating debs
22351 Virgina *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
22357 Madison :  european cant say shit about us government look at there government now its falling apart
22357 Arlie :  Santo, i did some basic math, and figured, if the cost of the iraq war, had been used to purchase photovoltaic solar cells, we could have used them to generate almost 70% of all household electrical consumption over the next 25 years
22359 Elenora *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
22371 Santo :  haha that's great
22390 Arlie :  Santo, instead, we invaded a screwed up country, to protect oil, that we now have to pay double for
22391 Sherlene :  Horacio: whats d.o?
22393 Priscila :  europe pwnz.
22395 Madison :  iraq was a mistake 100 percent
22413 Madison :  Priscila: you live in ireland .........its not even as big as maine
22417 Jesse :  Arlie: easily, but you ignore the public-subsidy-for-private-profit aspect, which is prominent in .us political strategy AFAICS
22418 Reggie :  no worries, the money would have been spent on something equally stupid otherwise
22424 Jesse :  Sherlene: debian.org
22429 Arlie :  they should have sent every soldier chasing down osama bin ladens ugly ass....and just let iraq work out its own problems
22433 Raquel *  entered the room.
22434 Santo :  Reggie: like the war on drugs
22436 Sherlene :  Horacio: lol I was messing!
22438 Priscila :  Madison: maine is the only american state that has only one syllabal
22447 Sherlene :  Horacio: thanks.
22451 Arlie :  Santo, the war on drugs is a good source of income
22454 Jesse :  Sherlene: ah ;)
22454 Madison :  Priscila: jus saying
22458 Santo :  Arlie: true
22461 Madison :  maine is a peice of shit
22464 Santo :  Arlie: it's absolutely stupid, as well
22495 Madison :  Santo: i love us government hate current administration well not hate but i think some of thier decision were stupid
22496 Arlie :  Santo, i dont think so
22507 Madison :  but i also think thsis hardcore liberal left is also to blame
22516 Raquel :  imo, without war on drugs, natural selection would work more efficiently! ;)
22533 Madison :  people like john kerry and al gore aint any better
22538 Arlie :  Santo, i think arresting people and ruining their lives because they were smoking a joint is stupid, but as far as real drugs like heroine and cocaine and narcotics go ... its good to keep that shit in check
22538 Priscila :  Madison: Ireland is bigger than maine.
22543 Madison :  not much
22547 Azzie :  War on drugs started as a means to opress the immigrants (chineese at the time).
22547 Madison :  let me check
22554 Santo :  Americans are overprotective, sue-happy, obsessed with political correctness, and Bible-thumpers.  If that doesn't sound like a recipe for a failure of a government, I don't know what is.
22556 Rachel :  Prohibition proved that it is useless to try to keep people from using their drug of choice
22576 Madison :  Santo: your wrong
22580 Jesse :  Sherlene: http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/ may be of use
22581 Santo :  Madison: you're
22586 Madison :  your wrong
22589 Santo :  you're
22590 Madison :  anyways
22592 Madison :  not gonna fight
22598 Sherlene :  Horacio: Thanks man
22599 Arlie :  Santo, to an extent you are correct on that one, but allowing people to snort cocaine, get addicted, steal other peoples cars, and shoot each other with guns, all because they are tweaked out and need another line, isnt good
22602 Madison :  most of america is not bible thumpers
22606 Jesse :  Sherlene: you're welcome
22617 Arlie :  Santo, its a proven fact that narcotics fuck people and society up
22620 Nadene *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
22621 Santo :  Arlie: see The Kingdom of The Netherlands
22624 Madison :  i do agree with political correctness but EUROpE is the breeding ground for that
22637 Arlie :  Santo, is cocaine and heroine legal in the netherlands ?
22638 Rachel :  Bible-thumpers being exploited by deep undercover Business agents sounds like a recipe for a failure of the US governmen
22639 Azzie :  Arlie: By the same token, allowing someone to gamble, lose all their money, steal a car, and shoot someone, cause they lost all their money isnt good.
22644 Lorraine *  left the room (quit: "Bye =]").
22657 Arlie :  Azzie, gambling isnt physically addictive
22658 Azzie :  Arlie: Take it a step further even, allowing someone to invest in the stock market.
22661 Santo :  Arlie: no, but their whole policy is vastly different so that it actually works
22667 Azzie :  Arlie: Prove it.
22672 Azzie :  Arlie: Is caffeine?
22675 Arlie :  Santo, sure, i can buy that
22678 Azzie :  Arlie: Or sugar?
22680 Madison :  political correctness just came into play in the 70's here
22689 Jose *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
22694 Arlie :  Santo, they arent much on education and rehabilitation here
22697 Chauncey *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
22702 Santo :  The drug policy of the Netherlands is based on 2 principles:
22702 Santo :     1. Drug use is a public health issue, not a criminal matter
22702 Santo :     2. A distinction between hard drugs and soft drugs exists
22721 Lynna *  left the room (quit: ).
22725 Demetrius *  entered the room.
22732 Arlie :  Santo, yup, drug use is a health issue, until a crack head beats down an old women in the wal-mart parking lot, which happend a couple days ago
22734 Madison :  amsterdam has become a place of do anything
22741 Madison :  destroy families
22751 Raquel :  (ot) do you guys know of a dev forum, support oriented that would be like freenode but in a forum shape?
22753 Madison :  i was in a plane once
22756 Azzie :  Arlie: What do you consider religion then?
22759 Madison :  the guy next to me was from there
22769 Arlie :  Azzie, religion is the most dangerous drug of all
22775 Jesse :  Arlie: that's because the prohibition makes it unaffordable - the gubment sets the price of illegal drugs
22781 Azzie :  Arlie: Outlaw it?
22781 Madison :  he had a family and he and a bunch of other used to go fuck some eastern european women from amsterdam in those shops or whatever
22785 Arlie :  Horacio, it does not
22792 Francoise *  entered the room.
22793 Arlie :  Horacio, and noone can afford crack
22810 Jesse :  Arlie: it most definitely does, by the penalties for distribution
22825 Sherlene :  Drugs is a problem everywhere. be it legal or not
22825 Madison :  im dooooooone
22831 Azzie :  Point being, making it illegal obviously wont stop them from using it, It would just keep them from already being a vigilante by doing so.
22835 Arlie :  the whole idea behind making possession or sale of crack illegal ... is that you can potentially stop someone from becomming addicted earlier than if you just let 7-11 sell it to anyone that wants it
22838 Jesse :  the actual cost of producing crack is neglibible
22844 Madison :  Santo: hope you like americaa cause if i had it my way you would be on a plane back to romania
22859 Santo :  Madison: do you drive a 1991 F250?
22862 Rachel :   prohibition doesn't makes it unaffordable . it makes it slightly more expensive, slightly ,more attractive and sends the money to organized criminals
22863 Azzie :  From my point of view, if you are already doing something illegal, youre more likely to go with the well, im already a criminal, ill just go with it.
22873 Madison :  Santo: i would never drve a truck
22881 Arlie :  Azzie, its a physically addictive drug
22888 Jesse :  Arlie: there may be good reasons for the prohibition (I'm not convinced), but it is the prohibition that ups the price, and cause the resultant crime
22888 Azzie :  Arlie: So is caffeine!
22902 Rachel :  yes, people steal to feed the habit.
22908 Azzie :  Arlie: And are you implying that physically adicting is worse than mentally?
22919 Arlie :  Azzie, yes
22927 Rachel :  but alcoholics steal for the same reason.. albeit possible a great deal less.
22930 Hue *  entered the room.
22930 Madison :  Santo: i was kidding but atleast look at what made the usa what it is ........its government is not that bad its very good few changes need to be made .......look at what carter did to the usa .........next president will make everything good again
22943 Jesse :  Rachel: booze is extremely heavily taxed, everywhere
22952 Allegra *  entered the room.
22954 Arlie :  alcohol is legal for a reason
22955 Sherlene :  is this a linux channel or a political debate channel?
22958 Rachel :  Horacio: yes,
22958 Azzie :  Well, ill let you go on with that, but even so.  If someone is smoking something they are not a criminal, if they are stealing they are, that should just be common sense.
22962 Rachel :  Sherlene: yes. :-)
22962 Jesse :  Rachel: again, the state has artificially inflated the price
22976 Arlie :  the outcome of drinking alcohol is a net positive factor for the economy and government
22979 Santo :  Madison: the United States would be shit if it had its current government but not its vast wealth
22984 Sherlene :  both ;-)
22986 Jesse :  Sherlene: it degenerates frequently, coincidentally when Arlie has the floor ;)
22992 Azzie :  If you make someone a criminal for smoking something, you are just opressing them for their personal choices into a class of criminals.
22996 Rachel :  Horacio: yes, but not - folks donbt go to jail for using, and the tax money can (should) be used to treat those who become addicted
23000 Arlie :  alcoholics typically get drunk, wake up, and go to work, and rush through work, to make it to 5pm, so they can get another beer
23000 Madison :  Santo: governmen made wealth btw
23000 Ling *  left the room (quit: Excess Flood).
23005 Raquel :  Sherlene, yeah, support is suspended for a few minutes/hours, enjoy! =D
23019 Santo :  Madison: not the current government.
23021 Madison :  Santo: more people does not == more wealth
23025 Alisa :  Arlie: crack wouldn't exist if it weren't for drug regulation.
23027 Allegra :  cigarettes are worse than alcohol
23027 Arlie :  alcohol passifies people....it keeps them sedated
23031 Allegra :  alcohol is good :)
23032 Jesse :  Sherlene: /ignore is at your disposal ;)
23033 Madison :  Santo: ok ?
23038 Sherlene :  lol
23046 Rachel :  Sherlene: Support ?'s take priority here, whats up?
23052 Ling *  entered the room.
23055 Jesse :  Sherlene: ##linux - "all of the noise, none of the signal"
23057 Allegra :  I call alcohol a "personality enhancer" :)
23060 Hailey *  entered the room.
23062 Azzie :  Horacio: lol!
23063 Arlie :  watch the videos on tv of cops pulling over drunks .... they arent that hard to deal with ... they fall down all by themselves
23068 Allegra :  because that's what it is
23073 Lashon *  entered the room.
23077 Sherlene :  savetheworld: No I am cool man, I had a packer question, but Horacio answered me!
23085 Santo :  Madison: I never said More People = More Wealth.  20 years ago the economy was vastly better than now
23089 Rachel :  Sherlene: :)
23094 Nadene *  entered the room.
23095 Arlie :  now ... pump a gram of meth into someone ... its gonna take 5 people to hold that guy down
23100 Sherlene :  Horacio: Its good to see ethics still matter!
23100 Santo :  Madison: and who spent billions and billions of dollars on silly things?  the current US government.
23104 Madison :  Santo: umm 80's economy was bad
23109 Madison :  90's was good
23110 Arlie :  because meth turns a sickly anemic geek into superman
23114 Santo :  i meant 90's
23117 Santo :  it's almost been 20 years
23122 Madison :  not yeyt
23123 Nadene *  left the room (quit: SendQ exceeded).
23125 Madison :  well
23126 Santo :  round up
23126 Rachel :  Arlie: no no - python turns a sickly anemic geek into superman! :-)
23135 Arlie :  Rachel, yeah ;)
23136 Missy :  how can i boot to runlevel 1 if the sys is hung during reboot?
23143 Jesse :  Santo: well, in .us nearly a trillion dollars a year is taken from people who do useful things, and given to the pentagon and its corporate friends - no wonder things become fux0red
23145 Allegra :  Who here thinks drugs should be legalised? :)
23146 Madison :  its inflation deflation government controlled Santo you need both
23153 Rachel :  Allegra: me
23157 Alisa :  Allegra: me too.
23158 Madison :  you need to give people time to catch up to the current gvernment
23158 Nadene *  entered the room.
23162 Blondell *  left the room (quit: ).
23164 Tasha :  Allegra: and taxed.
23166 Madison :  econoy sorry
23167 Rachel :  yes
23169 Allegra :  cool :) BEcause they should :)
23170 Allegra :  yeap
23175 Arlie :  guys
23178 Sherlene :  drugs should not be legalisez ever
23182 Arlie :  the truth of the matter is, drugs are already legal
23186 Nadene :  how do I convince my university to start a linux lab
23187 Arlie :  if you use them responsibly
23187 Santo :  Madison: it's not about inflation and deflation.  it's about bush having to finish what his daddy started and wanting to play cowboy.
23201 Allegra :  Nadene: death threats?
23202 Madison :  Santo: stop blaming your problems on bush
23209 Rachel :  booze , grass, crack - all legal and taxed (but you keep you fsckn hands OFF MY COFFEE!!! )
23211 Jesse :  Sherlene: certainly not - how else could we ensure that vast sums of money reached the hands of the most violent criminal gangs?
23215 Madison :  bush does not have the power congress has
23220 Santo :  Madison: i'm not.  i'm saying that his administration made America a laughing stock
23223 Arlie :  if your in your home, smoking weed or snorting coke, in moderation, and your not all out of control, the feds arent gonna bust down your door and arrest you ... noone is ever gonna know
23229 Jesse :  Sherlene: the alcohol prohibition was an outstanding success
23230 Tasha :  Nadene: set up a linux terminal server
23231 Santo :  eg: Gonzales
23233 Allegra :  crack shouldn't be legalised, because once you try it you are hooked for life
23236 Floria *  entered the room.
23239 Madison :  Santo: immigration is still higher then any othr country ?
23247 Sherlene :  Horacio: exactly, its like pirate DVDs sold in my country, are used to fund terrorism
23265 Jesse :  Sherlene: right - were'd you hear that?
23277 Allegra :  Sherlene: Canada?
23277 Santo :  Madison: yes, because people with a poorer quality of life will immigrate to a country with a better quality of life if they opportunity arrises
23279 Allegra :  :p
23281 Alvaro *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).

23295 Allegra :  Sherlene: you mean the IRA?
23301 Francoise *  is now known as Francoise
23306 Jesse :  Sherlene: I assume you are being jocose once again
23307 Madison :  Santo: i have travled europe i have seen people make good money their whole life for a 1 bedroom flat .........in france in spain .......romania was corrupt as fuck dangerous as hell ........we had a bodyguard .......UK is a little better ......kinda still a nice house cost 2 + million ....... Santo so please ......
23311 Arlie :  Jamar, theres special filesystems and block drivers in the kernel source tree for that
23315 Mirella *  entered the room.
23318 Sherlene :  ya man, I know that may not sound patriotic, but times have passed
23344 Jamar :  hey Arlie - the system currently has a small HDD in it - would it be easy to swap?
23352 Arlie :  Jamar, swap ?
23356 Allegra :  but currently, if legalising all drugs is unacceptable, at least marijuana should be legalised
23362 Ching *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
23365 Madison :  Santo: government takes care of thier people .......thats why its better here .......if you didnt have rule and the kind of security etc there would be widespreadd corruptin and it would be bad
23366 Allegra :  and cigarettes illegalised
23366 Santo :  Madison: so please what?  i'm not saying "country __ is so much better than America!" I'm saying "Look at how many of your government employees cannot recall anything."
23372 Hilde *  left the room (quit: "leaving").
23373 Jamar :  Arlie: as in make the switch between the filesystems etc
23379 Arlie :  Jamar, you need to install a bootable distro on the flash, and tell the mobo bios to boot from it ... its a seperate install
23385 Nadene :  legalize linux!
23394 Madison :  Santo: if you bitch at usa PLEASE bitch as france uk and spain first
23396 Arlie :  Jamar, after that, you can take the hard drive out if you want
23400 Jesse :  Santo: power causes amnesia
23409 Arlena *  entered the room.
23409 Santo :  Horacio: haha!
23410 Madison :  Santo: not to mention the fallen eastern europe
23413 Allegra :  Madison: all capitalism countries are crap :)
23421 Madison :  this is capitalisim
23424 Allegra :  Madison: so are most of communist/socialist
23426 Nadene :  truth
23428 Madison :  the first capitlistic country
23429 Jamar :  Arlie: I realise that... but as the drive acts as an IDE device, could I not copy the existing filesystem onto it and just boot directly off that?
23431 Nadene :  death to capitalism
23432 Allegra :  Madison: hahahaha
23438 Madison :  besides greece
23439 Sherlene :  personnally I sway a little to the right myself!
23445 Arlie :  Jamar, not really, but sort of
23447 Allegra :  Madison: america is not the first capitalist country
23450 Rob *  entered the room.
23455 Madison :  Sherlene: look at hat the left has done to europe
23455 Allegra :  capitalism was present from the stone ages
23461 Tasha :  all should be anarchy.  anarchy rules.  anarchists of the world, unite.
23462 Madison :  i jus said greece
23467 Tatiana *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
23467 Allegra :  communism is a higher level, eveolution
23467 Rob :  Is anyone here really good at openoffice?
23471 Arlie :  Jamar, i mean, this is an IDE flash drive ? that plugs into the IDE controller ?
23478 Nadene :  communism for the win!
23478 Sherlene :  Madison: They are destroying it man.
23479 Allegra :  Tasha: workers... workers of the world unite :)
23489 Jesse :  Allegra: "This, however, is a passing nightmare; in time the earth will become again incapable of supporting life, and peace will return." -- Bertrand Russell ;)
23501 Madison :  Sherlene: if you are in usa you dont really see the media doesnt show how bad france and spain is and UK
23501 Allegra :  Horacio: :)
23503 Bryce *  offers his very nice home and cars to the state....
23506 Jamar :  Arlie: yes. it's an adapter that connects to an IDE cable and allows you to use a compact flash card. the bios just sees it as a hard drive.
23511 Demetrius :  personally looking forward to oatmeal for every meal
23514 Arlie :  Jamar, if so, you'll want to a) make sure you have kernel supprt, either compiled in, or as a module, for the special flash filesystems, then b) copy all the files over then c) fix the boot config so it works
23519 Richie *  entered the room.
23529 Allegra :  Demetrius: obviously you have much to learn :)
23531 Sherlene :  Madison: Are you in the USA?
23536 Nadene :  Demetrius: oatmeal is good
23536 Madison :  Sherlene: work your whole life at a good paying educated job for a small ass 1 bred room flat apartment
23539 Madison :  yes i am
23542 Madison :  but i lived in europe
23544 Demetrius :  I love oatmeal... I wasnt joking
23545 Jamar :  Arlie: I see.
23547 Arlie :  Jamar, so, yes, you can copy the stuff over, but no, you can do it right with just 'dd' or anything
23553 Sunni *  entered the room.
23567 Nadene :  Madison: that's life
23567 Rob *  left the room.
23573 Arlie :  Jamar, since you want the special filesystem that supports wear levelling on it, and not just whatever is on the IDE drive now
23575 Madison :  Nadene: what do you mean ?
23575 Nadene :  revolt and break stuff is what I say
23576 Sherlene :  Madison: Ireland is one of the last that will go I think
23580 Jesse :  Madison: wtf does that?
23587 Sherlene :  Madison: UK is pretty F*****
23587 Madison :  ?
23594 Madison :  does what ?
23595 Jamar :  Arlie: yeah. do you have any links regarding said filesystem?
23599 Arlie :  Jamar, i dont know the name of the fs, or the module name, i just saw the options last night as i was compiling a kernel
23601 Nadene :  break stuff
23601 Madison :  Sherlene: where you at ?
23605 Alvaro *  entered the room.
23606 Demetrius :  I like capitalism just fine, I just hate lobbyists and politicians
23608 Sherlene :  Madison: Ireland
23612 Madison :  oooo
23614 Arlie :  Jamar, its in the kernel 'make menuconfig' menus under filesystems
23615 Allegra :  Horacio: I gather you lean to the left?
23617 Allegra :   :P
23619 Ellena *  entered the room.

23633 Madison :  Horacio: does what ?
23633 Demetrius :  and I really like Ireland....gonna be back in a few months for a wedding
23634 Jamar :  hopefully it'd be compiled into ubuntu feisty...
23637 Jesse :  Allegra: left of what?
23650 Jesse :  Madison: sorry, never mind, I'm too tired
23652 Allegra :  Demetrius: capitalism is not good. it is law of the jungle, and forces man to fight his fellow man
23653 Madison :  Sherlene: hope so havent really looked into ireland
23659 Sherlene :  Demetrius: ya really? what part?
23668 Allegra :  Horacio: political
23672 Demetrius :  Sherlene, guess I'll fly into DUB and drive to Co. Cork
23672 Madison :  Horacio: if you were disputing my clain  on how it is i can give you much needed proof
23681 Lita *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
23683 Demetrius :  may fly into Shannon if I can get a better reate
23689 Sherlene :  Madison: Its not bad, but then again we are part of the EU, which sucks
23689 Demetrius :  s/reate/rate
23701 Madison :  ireland is fine but its cold :(
23709 Jesse :  Madison: I'm certain I have far more counter-examples, having lived in Yurp most of my life
23709 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: I live near enough to Cork, I live in Limerick
23713 Madison :  liberalisim will make a country fall
23721 Madison :  whats ok for them is not for you
23731 Priscila :  Madison: ireland > Madison.location
23738 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: Ryan Air is cheap, and uses shannon primarily
23739 Demetrius :  Sherlene, driven through Limerick (and wrote one on the way as well )
23743 Madison :  Horacio: sorry buddy ........lived in france spain and UK
23747 Jesse :  Allegra: a one dimensional political spectrum is quite useless IMHO
23747 Madison :  i know how it is
23751 Demetrius :  Sherlene, Ryan doesn't fly trans atlantic
23751 Allegra :  Madison: liberalism?
23759 Madison :  yep
23764 Madison :  extreme left will
23766 Madison :  you need a balance
23767 Ali *  entered the room.
23770 Allegra :  Horacio: hm.. no.. as socialism combines communism and "democracy"
23777 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: Sorry, I keep forgeting I am talking to Yanks lol
23786 Madison :  thats why people bash a 2 party system but this 10 yars it leans to left and the next 10 years to the right
23791 Demetrius :  Sherlene,  :)
23801 Gail *  entered the room.
23803 Genevive *  entered the room.

23818 Madison :  Carter ???????/
23820 Jesse :  Madison: may one ask for how long you lived in these places?
23820 Allegra :  Madison: it's basically a one party system
23825 Madison :  he almost made it part of the soviet union
23841 Madison :  read about carter
23852 Allegra :  Madison: one person. Look at Clinton's (D) policies, they do niot defer from R policies
23855 Arletha *  entered the room.

23866 Madison :  the country was built on a conservative motive
23867 Melvin *  entered the room.
23869 Arletha :  can you get quickbooks running on linux?
23873 Laurene *  entered the room.
23874 Demetrius :  (and Ryan Air has no FC....flight snob here:)  )
23875 Madison :  so people want to keep it that way obviously
23878 Allegra :  Madison: no.. actually it wasn;t
23882 Madison :  it was
23882 Jesse :  Allegra: in .us, there's only one party, the large corporation party ;)
23894 Allegra :  Madison: Jefferson and all of them sound pretty liberal to me
23897 Madison :  Allegra: far more conservative then you ever know
23900 Faustino *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
23903 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: FC!!! nice, economy suits me! student budgets suck!
23904 Allegra :  Horacio: yeah.. President Halliburton :D
23907 Madison :  i guess slavery was what ?
23914 Jesse :  Allegra: that's the veep
23923 Demetrius :  Sherlene, I just have an amazing surplus of frequenty flyer miles :)
23928 Madison :  they used to execute people in town square WTF are you talking about
23935 Allegra :  Horacio: the real prez is a puppet
23941 Madison :  until the last 100 years it been every man for himself
23942 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: Ever consider a career in Aviation?
23942 Allegra :  Madison: treason is punishable by death :)
23944 Demetrius :  last time I landed in DUB I was so drunk from the flight...what a miserable first day
23952 Sherlene :  lol
23955 Jesse :  Allegra: so it would appear
23961 Madison :  Allegra: good the rosemburgs fried too
23966 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: Sounds like me on evry flight!
23966 Demetrius :  Sherlene, I'm a pilot...but only single engine 4 seaters :)
23979 Madison :  Demetrius: really ?

24009 Madison :  no
24013 Demetrius :  I fly so much comerically now that I hardly have a chance to stay legal :(
24019 Madison :  black people were only 2/3 man
24028 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: lol
24037 Jesse :  Allegra: 'men' - there was doubt (and still seems to be in some quarters ;) that that included blacks
24042 Madison :  Allegra: read it man lol

24080 Demetrius :  Sherlene, I'm actually drinking a Guinness right now
24084 Allegra :  Horacio: oh..
24091 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: its nice all the same. I hate the citys tho.
24095 Allegra :  Horacio: I still think capitalism sucks :)
24100 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: Cant bate a pint of plain!
24103 Richie :  hi
24105 Bryce *  lives in Virginia USA....absolutely perfect :)
24107 Richie :  i am   Richie
24109 Madison :  Demetrius: could you land a plane if it had a engine malfunction ?
24117 Jesse :  Allegra: you think it should be forbidden to benefit from your labours?
24118 Demetrius :  Sherlene, what cities ? :)
24118 Renate *  entered the room.
24123 Madison :  Demetrius: kinda good weather south carolina is better though ;)
24128 Demetrius :  Madison, I'd have to!
24138 Jesse :  Richie: so it would seem...
24144 Azzie :  Location are different, not better.
24146 Madison :  whats the sucess rate ?
24147 Renate :  theoretical question, if Jack Thompson were to sue Microsoft, who would you root for?
24148 Demetrius :  Madison, ohhh I do love me some low country...going down to Hilton Head in a few weeks
24148 Allegra :  Horacio: no, I think it should be forbidden to fight your fellow man to benefit
24153 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: All Citys. I am from Lim, but I usually live in the country away from roads, Jana I cant sleep with the noise of cars! lol
24157 Florrie *  entered the room.
24161 Madison :  Demetrius: more mild weather
24168 Allegra :  Horacio: analyse the system.. people with different jobs, have different pays right?
24170 Sherlene :  Weather aint bad here
24171 Jesse :  Allegra: aggressive war is forbidden by international law
24179 Madison :  Sherlene: it gets cold
24182 Azzie :  West coast is most mild weather in US
24184 Madison :  Sherlene: plam trees ?
24185 Allegra :  Horacio: I don't mean like that
24194 Madison :  Azzie: south by far
24195 Demetrius :  Sherlene, I was making a bad joke...I'm kinda a country boy myself (at heart) but Dub was so small compaired to Paris or London or even something like Atlanta
24204 Arlinda *  left the room ("Coming Back").
24204 Arlinda *  entered the room.
24205 Allegra :  Horacio: I think it is unfair that a surgeon and a street cleaner don't make the same amount of money
24207 Ching *  entered the room.
24210 Sherlene :  Madison: Palm trees brought here ya!!! Its just bad in certain parts
24214 Azzie :  Its geography fact - Oceans moderate temperature.
24220 Demetrius :  Allegra, do you really?
24222 Allegra :  Horacio: Who is to say that the street cleaner doesn't work just as hard?
24228 Madison :  Sherlene: ireland have plam trees ?
24232 Allegra :  Demetrius: yes
24234 Azzie :  For this reason, south cali fluxuates around 20degrees all year
24241 Jesse :  Allegra: I think that view is absurd - it is a question of rarity
24248 Madison :  the whole south of usa is mild
24254 Allegra :  Horacio: no.. it is a question of ability
24254 Madison :  coasst never gets cold
24261 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: Ya its pretty small man in comparison. You should try some of the nice countys. like Kerry. to see the real beauty here
24268 Jesse :  Allegra: the _differential_ may be excessive, but IMHO it's absurd to suggest they should be paid the same
24270 Allegra :  Horacio: a street cleaner might not have been BORN intelligent enough to be a surgeon
24273 Azzie :  When i lived in houston it was 40-50 in winter and 100+ in summer
24284 Arlie :  Allegra, thats not our problem
24286 Allegra :  Horacio: maybe not the same, but the difference should be minor
24291 Jesse :  Allegra: that's too bad - that's like saying hideous people have a right to be models
24298 Arlie :  Allegra, he's lucky we had enough money to buy him a truck and pay him to clean the street
24301 Allegra :  Horacio: no it's not
24306 Allegra :  no..
24309 Allegra :  it's not his fault
24318 Demetrius :  Allegra, put it another way... to be a CT surgeon you go to college for 4 years...then med school for 4...then residency for 2-3...then a specific CT residency for 2...so you are close to 37 before you can practice, but your education is worth over $200,000.00 ...and frankly I want my CT surgeon to make more than a street cleaner
24321 Allegra :  he wasn't born intelligent enough to get a better job
24321 Arlie :  Allegra, but just because he wants to clean streets, doesnt mean we shouldnt be allowed to make a fortune on wall street
24331 Madison :  average temp in houstn for winter is 63 F
24334 Lashunda *  entered the room.
24337 Demetrius :  Sherlene, I love Kerry!
24338 Lia *  entered the room.
24340 Arlie :  Allegra, each according to his own abilities ... capitalism allows that
24341 Lashunda *  left the room.
24345 Ali :  just wondering, what is the difference between exe files for windows and binary files for linux, except their references to the OS? don't they both have binary instructions that look completely alike (same cpu nomatter what os you use, which use the same instructions)?
24348 Jesse :  Allegra: it's not a question of fault, it's a question of what service people value more - saving life is worth more to people than a rubbish free street
24350 Katrice *  entered the room.
24357 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: Where abouts in Kerry have you been?
24366 Allegra :  Horacio: what if noone cleaned the streets?
24370 Demetrius :  like I said, I love capitalism...I just hate the politicians and lobbyists
24373 Allegra :  Horacio: disease!
24374 Allegra :  :)
24376 Demetrius :  lol
24376 Katrice :  does anyone use a logitech G11 gaming keyboard in linux?
24379 Allegra :  Horacio: 1666 - plague
24389 Arlie :  Allegra, then the salary of street cleaners gets raised to the level where someone will step up and do it
24394 Allegra :  Horacio: greatest invention ever - soap = hygiene
24394 Katrice :  I am curious how easily the extra keys are set to be macros, for functions and what not
24399 Demetrius :  Sherlene, ..brb...dinner in the oven
24410 Demetrius :  (and thats not a euphmisim )
24416 Jesse :  Allegra: not really - I've lived somewhere where the streets were not cleaned for months on end, for various reasons; there was no more disease than normal
24417 Sherlene :  SpaceBassLap: Take care man, I have to head to bed!
24417 Allegra :  Arlie: every job which gives a service to society is worth the same
24419 Winston *  entered the room.
24420 Arlie :  the plaque wasnt caused by lack of soap
24423 Allegra :  because we are allinter-dependable
24424 Sherlene :  G'luck lads!
24425 Demetrius :  Allegra, antibiotics
24427 Arlie :  er..plauge
24428 Madison :  anyways im out wasted more time
24431 Sherlene *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
24445 Winston :  how can i use the mouse in putty? for say lynx ...
24446 Alvaro *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
24453 Allegra :  Horacio: not months, years, no cleaner ever..
24465 Allegra :  Winston: you need to tunnel and forward X
24466 Jesse :  Allegra: bubonic plague is trivially cured by standard antibiotics these days - amoxycillin does the job quite nicely
24479 Allegra :  Horacio: still, hygiene is needed :)
24486 Jesse :  Allegra: after a couple of months it doesn't get any worse
24497 Allegra :  Horacio: it would after a few years
24499 Jesse :  Allegra: dogs and rats and crows etc eat it
24500 Winston :  Allegra: without using X, is it possible?
24513 Jesse :  Allegra: you have no idea what you're talking about
24516 Renate *  left the room ("Leaving").
24525 Arlie :  Allegra, at the time of the plauge, people tossed their poo into the streets and walked through it ... that was the norm
24545 Arlie :  Allegra, also, there is alot of evidence to show that the increased rat population was do to climate changes
24546 Allegra :  Horacio: it is logical, that if you throw garbage into garbage cans and noone takes it away
24557 Jesse :  Allegra: not cans, into the street
24574 Allegra :  Horacio: that's what happens when garbage cans are not emptied
24576 Arlie :  Allegra, in the middle ages, the polite upper class urinated in the stairwell
24579 Jesse :  Allegra: I'm not interested in your 'logic', I've _seen_ it
24581 Demetrius :  Allegra, where are you from?
24587 Allegra :  Arlie: lol
24588 Jesse :  Arlie: they still do ;)
24592 Nilsa *  left the room (quit: "A cow. A trampoline. Together, they fight crime.").
24592 Allegra :  Horacio: for a few months
24593 Arlie :  Allegra, its the truth
24601 Allegra :  Horacio: not enough, is it?
24612 Allegra :  Demetrius: croatia, living in the cayman islands
24618 Jesse :  Allegra: yeah, 8 or 9 once IIRC - like I said, it reaches a level and stays there
24623 Demetrius :  Allegra, cool
24641 Allegra :  Horacio: that's impossible.. people stop generating garbage?
24654 Tambra *  entered the room.
24655 Allegra :  Horacio: if the level stays the same that means someone takes the garbage away
24659 Demetrius :  hows the tax haven of the world?
24667 Arlie :  so ... dumping poo in the street + walking through it + urinating in the stairwell + increase in rat population = plauge .... not lack of soap
24669 Madison :  Allegra: whats up wiht you eastern europeans today
24671 Jesse :  Allegra: ffs, can you not read - it is eaten, by dogs, rats, birds, etc.
24675 Allegra :  Demetrius: ok.. nothing special :/
24676 Kathleen *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
24678 Madison :  romania croatia
24692 Allegra :  Horacio: rats eat aluminium cans? :P
24702 Allegra :  Madison: croatia is a part of central europe
24708 Madison :  wel
24711 Madison :  close enough
24712 Tambra *  left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
24713 Allegra :  Madison: and we were never part of the soviet union
24718 Madison :  well
24721 Madison :  edge right ?
24724 Jesse :  Allegra: almost all of the rubbish is organic
24725 Arlie :  Allegra, theres something you dont understand when you say you would like to abolish capitalism
24734 Richie *  left the room.
24736 Allegra :  Arlie: and that is?
24740 Arlie :  Allegra, its the same as saying, you would like to take away all hope people might harbour for a better life
24745 Madison :  you abolish capitalisim we will be eating rice
24750 Bryce *  is eating and organic meal right now....does that help?
24752 Alvaro *  entered the room.
24762 Arlie :  Allegra, because if capitalism provides nothing else, it provides a chance ... ie hope ... to make a better life
24766 Allegra :  Arlie: not true, communism is the next step :)
24768 Jesse :  Allegra: this whole idiotic discussion arose out of your absurd suggestion that a street cleaner should be paid the same a surgeon
24771 Demetrius :  like I said, I love capitalism...I just hate the politicians and lobbyists
24774 Arlie :  Allegra, communism takes away hope
24779 Winston :  what;s the best program to split a terminal window?
24781 Madison :  Allegra: why the cayman islands ?
24782 Allegra :  Arlie: and communism provides a standard and equality
24786 Madison :  what are you there for ?
24790 Allegra :  Madison: because:P
24793 Jesse :  Winston: screen can do it, or there's splitvt
24798 Madison :  any specific reason ?
24801 Arlie :  Allegra, you dont want to work hard or smart to make something of yourself, instead, you want to take the people and families who have done that, and drag them down to your level
24805 Arlie :  Allegra, shame on you
24808 Demetrius :  there is nothing wrong me me building a better mouse trap...the problem is when the lobbiests convience the gov't to protect the old mouse trap
24809 Allegra :  Horacio: it makes sense :)
24816 Nadene :  I hi
24825 Nadene :  communism is still better
24826 Jesse :  Allegra: it denies people the right to benefit from their efforts, which is a great injustice IMHO
24827 Allegra :  Arlie: no, raise everybody to the same level
24833 Arlie :  Allegra, then everyone is poor
24837 Allegra :  in USA 43% of the people are below the poverty line :)
24837 Juliette *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
24838 Jesse :  Allegra: 'equality' cannot be 'provided'
24840 Arlie :  Allegra, you have to force them to be equal
24843 Madison :  Allegra: trying to be clse to Cuba ?
24849 Arlie :  Allegra, its not a natural state of affairs
24850 Madison :  why not go live there
24853 Kathleen *  entered the room.
24860 Allegra :  Arlie: yes it is..
24864 Madison :  Allegra: OH no
24864 Arlie :  Allegra, no, it isnt
24867 Allegra :  where everybody works for the good of the community
24869 Madison :  you got your facts wrong
24870 Allegra :  not for themselves
24872 Arlie :  Allegra, fuck you and your community
24878 Arlie :  Allegra, you dont own me
24887 Allegra :  if everyone does good you do good
24889 Madison :  if half the usa was living in poveryty this place would be a shit hole
24892 Allegra :  if everyone has a good life
24897 Arlie :  Allegra, if you want something i have, then lets agree on a price and trade, if not, hit the road
24898 Allegra :  you have a good life
24918 Madison :  Arlie: communisim never worked
24922 Arlie :  Allegra, its a really simple system that works quite well
24924 Allegra :  Arlie: no.. for example, you grow crops, I bottle water.. I give my water, share it, you share your crops
24926 Allegra :  in the end
24929 Allegra :  I get some crops
24931 Allegra :  and you get water
24940 Arlie :  Allegra, thats allowed under capitalism already
24940 Nicki :   /join #politics
24940 Allegra :  to each according to his needs :)
24942 Madison :  it does not wooooooork
24942 Jesse :  Madison: no one actually tried it, similarly with capitalism ;)
24949 Arlie :  Allegra, needy people suck
24950 Allegra :  from each according to his abilities
24955 Madison :  the doctor wants more then the water pourer
24964 Madison :  Horacio: russians ?
24966 Madison :  Cuba ?
24972 Allegra :  Madison: want and need are different things :)
24976 Jesse :  Allegra: unfortunately, we don't live in the early stone age
24977 Madison :  lol
24977 Allegra :  I got to go eat dinner :)
24977 Madison :  no
24979 Allegra :  so bye
24986 Madison :  peple want to better themselves
24991 Madison :  if you dont give hat hope
24992 Allegra :  Horacio: capitalism will fail :)
24996 Madison :  there is noting
24999 Allegra :  Horacio: it did in 1929, it will fail again
25002 Demetrius :  whats interesting to me is that this discussion is in #linux... on the outset its easy to see FLOSS as a very socialistic thing but theres clearly room for it in capitalism too...its interesting
25016 Madison :  wow
25016 Allegra :  only through Roosevelt's leftist policies was America dragged out of the depression
25019 Jesse :  Madison: bolshevism has little to do with communism, it was more like the Strausism espoused by the less retarded neocons, like Wolfowitz
25022 Allegra :  and you cannot deny that :)
25023 Madison :  Allegra: go back t croatia
25024 Alisa :  Socialism vs. Capitalism debate :) I was wondering when another one of these would happen, this morning.
25024 Jona *  entered the room.

25047 Madison :  yea enjoy your better quality of lfe
25049 Madison :  i like miami
25052 Jesse :  Allegra: quite possibly, but as I said, no one has really tried it - there has never yet been a remotely free market anywhere
25053 Arlie :  america was dragged out of the depression with financial reform ... dumb ass
25054 Madison :  cayman islands is poor as shit too
25056 Demetrius :  miami is nice

25116 Demetrius :  I love Virginia...I want to live here as long as I can...but I have to be able to travel
25122 Demetrius :  yep
25124 Tambra :  Hi,please I need Scanner driver (Benq 5000F), please ,, thank you..
25144 Jesse :  Arlie: you mean bolsheviks? I've never seen a real communist, they're all in favour of one tyranny or another IME
25149 Madison :  Demetrius: i preffer a little hotter climate
25159 Jesse :  Tambra: sane.org IIRC
25175 Tambra :  Horacio: thx friend
25186 Jesse :  Tambra: I'm wrong, hang on
25208 Tambra :  Horacio: ok

25214 Demetrius :  Madison, I'm a die hard skier... I've been tempted to move to Colorado...but I'm just not there
25228 Tambra :  Horacio: ok, thank u
25232 Arlie :  Horacio, i guess
25234 Astrid *  has never skiid, but cant count how much snowboarding

25248 Starla *  entered the room.
25249 Arlie :  Horacio, call them what you will ... but they show up, and start telling me they want to take away everyone i worked for
25256 Arlie :  er..everything
25258 Madison :  Demetrius: i hate snow
25264 Demetrius :  whats the difference b/t a snowboard and a vacuum cleaner?
25273 Demetrius :  Madison, youd have to to live in Miami :)
25283 Gail *  left the room (quit: ).
25284 Demetrius :  I'm headed to Tampa in a few weeks....looking forward to it
25299 Azzie :  lol
25303 Jesse :  Arlie: the neocons are curiously similar to bolsheviks - the idea of being an elite who lead the 'bewildered herd' in the right direction, nudging them with myths both inspiring and alarming, that the elite know are fraudulent
25341 Shira *  entered the room.
25346 Madison :  Demetrius: its nice place too check out st peterburg
25355 Arlie :  Horacio, the elite are elite for a reason ... some are elite because they are smart, others are elite simply because they have money ... either way, someone, in their family, somewhere, at some point in time, worked god damn hard for it
25376 Tambra *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
25380 Arlie :  now, it sucks that i didnt come from an elite, wealthy family ... oh well ... i got over it and i got busy
25393 Shira :  How do I append pci=nommconf to the isolinux.cfg? "append initrd=initrd.img rootdelay=5 pci=nommconf" does no work
25396 Vern *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
25399 Arlie :  because capitalism allows me to do that
25402 Demetrius :  Madison, I've never been to that part of the gulf coast...been to naples a few times... so I'm looking forward to it... the question is do I turn a biz trip into fun and fly my wife down and drive to Disney Land (I know, I know)
25404 Idella *  entered the room.

25556 Demetrius :  Madison, last time I was in miami I only spent 1 night...then drove to key west for a while... still I love me some fun in the sun
25568 Arlie :  Horacio, "Sometimes he made use of inside information in ways which would later be made illegal, but regulations were lighter in his era."
25576 Madison :  Demetrius: its healthy :P

25649 Madison :  i stay in miami and rio de janeiro
25650 Ezra *  entered the room.
25708 Jesse :  Arlie: right, and he only started importing alcohol after prohibition ended  - hahaha
25710 Denise *  entered the room.
25712 Mack :  Demetrius: i tested the begining of the tape the partition is /home @ 850KB/s   any other partition is 1455KB/s
25717 Arlie :  Horacio, he was already rich
25736 Arlie :  Horacio, according to wikipedia, he bought the importation rights during prohibition

25820 Starla *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
25829 Arlie :  Horacio, his kids of course, were pretty much all fuckups ;)
25843 Timmy :  hi i gonna try to install the backtrack tools on ubuntu anyone has try something like that  before????
25890 Demetrius :  Mack, I guess I'm wondering if maybe either the tape slows down as it get longer or maybe if the other partition has a lot of read/write during the copy/backup...either would make a difference
25965 Arletha *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).

26391 Lorita *  entered the room.
26410 Arlie :  Madison, seriously, im more of a developer than i am a vendor atm
26424 Arlie :  Madison, so i dont need a host just yet
26424 Alisa :  How can I get grep to return entries of a specific length?
26424 Madison :  i was kidding
26435 Arlie :  Madison, i see how you are
26440 Madison :  huh?
26454 Arlie :  Madison, you offer hosting, i say no, and then you say you were just kidding ?
26467 Arlie :  wtf ?
26470 Odelia *  left the room (quit: ).
26470 Madison :  lol
26472 Gale :  Alisa: one way is .......
26477 Madison :  i would assume you would not need it
26491 Arlie :  Madison, next time you want a question answered about forex, im gonna give you all the wrong answers, and after you lose $10,000 ... say "oh yeah, i was just kidding"
26499 Darline *  entered the room.
26502 Gale :  for your pattern
26525 Arlie :  Madison, i will eventually need a remote host

26692 Melvin *  left the room (quit: Read error: 113 (No route to host)).
26699 Azzie :  Arlie: Are you going with my plan? Create the server, post some stats, and offer hosting?
26712 Arlie :  Azzie, no
26721 Azzie :  Well, then.
26740 Arlie :  im going with my plan
26753 Azzie :  lol

26789 Azzie :  unrelated*
26802 Arlie :  unrelated to what ? a fast webserver ?
26805 Azzie :  Yes
26818 Arlie :  no ... a webserver is at the heart of it all
26829 Azzie :  Interesting.
26837 Brigida *  entered the room.
26859 Tasia :  Grep question: How do I print every part of a matching line *execpt* the part that actually matched?
26864 Arlie :  internet sales hit $100 billion dollars this year
26871 Erik :  I need the grub line kernel argument to disable the framebuffer. Is it just -nofb?
26940 Brigida *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
26955 Priscila :  Tasia: use sed.
26994 Arlie :  Azzie, i have a complete database engine for my webserver already ... just need to add some threads for it
26998 Tasia :  Priscila: Thanks, reading man page now :)
27002 Anya :  How do you keep someone confined to their home directory? I'm having someone ssh'ing in for irssi, but I don't want them to access the rest of my system
27025 Azzie :  Arlie: That reminds me, did you go with a seperate i/o thread design?
27043 Tasha :  Anya: have you looked at rssh?
27062 Jesse :  Erik: vga=normal ? I forget
27067 Erik :  Hmm.
27068 Azzie :  Anya: google chroot jail
27069 Erik :  I'll try that.
27072 Valda *  is now known as Valda
27084 Arlie :  Azzie, ive not bothered to try and unravel the state of affairs concerning asyncronous disk i/o in linux these days ... its fairly crazy and theres no clear path ... so yes, disk i/o is threaded
27088 Anya :  Tasha: nope
27091 Krystina *  entered the room.
27099 Gale :  maybe video=vga
27111 Gale :  look in the kernel docs
27115 Gale :  it will tell you
27151 Arlie :  Azzie, theres not much of an advantage to non-threaded disk i/o models, since they all seem to bypass the kernel block buffers ... which forces apps to do their own buffering/cacheing, which pretty much negates any gains from doing async disk i/o in the first place
27154 Idella *  left the room (quit: "Tirrrrrrrreeeeeeddddd").
27165 Azzie :  Arlie: Ah, I am doing asynchronous disk i/o but it runs on a seperate thread from the reqeust handler
27166 Arlie :  Azzie, although, i cant say ive tried all potential methods and timed them
27188 Arlie :  Azzie, async disk i/o for a webserver ? thats crazy ;)
27198 Katrice *  left the room (quit: "It is better to be quiet and let people assume your stupid, then to talk and prove it to them.").

27214 Azzie :  For caches
27223 Arlie :  Azzie, its a shame you didnt actually test this stuff first ;)
27243 Azzie :  Im scared of writing an app to test it.
27249 Azzie :  How did you go about it?
27273 Arlie :  you have to write a disk i/o benchmark program
27293 Von *  entered the room.
27294 Azzie :  Im referring to the request stress benchmark
27300 Azzie :  response times, rather
27306 Arlie :  parsing http requests ?
27311 Azzie :  Yep
27324 Arlie :  i coded a test app that did nothing but parse the same http request out of a buffer over and over and report req/sec
27334 Arlie :  was 500,000 ... recoded it to 900,000 req/sec
27342 Arlie :  just parsing a simple GET
27351 Harold *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
27355 Azzie :  And they were asyncronous requests?
27363 Nadene *  left the room (quit: "ubuntu ubuntu, they drink it in the congo").
27365 Arlie :  it was parsed from memory
27369 Azzie :  ah
27373 Arlie :  thats where socket data ends up
27375 Arlie :  in memory
27377 Krystina *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
27386 Arlie :  i cant control the socket layer ... thats in the kernel
27386 Nancey :  Hi, ah, can anyone help me find out how to determine the actual segment size of a process? I`am trying to understand when exactly an segfault occurs, which seems quite difficult without knowing the actual "memory-bounds" of a process =/
27387 Signe *  entered the room.
27388 Krystina *  entered the room.
27406 Azzie :  Yes, but even so, its a good way to test comparatively
27408 Von :  grrr, if these tech support people don't start providing support for linux i'll have to go back to windows
27417 Arlie :  Azzie, i tested my code
27421 Arlie :  Azzie, not kernel code
27425 Gale :  go to windows then
27425 Arlie :  the kernel is the kernel
27427 Azzie :  I know what youre saying.
27457 Arlie :  theres no point in hacking on the kernel to increase throughput, until you've done everything in userspace possible
27459 Tresa *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
27460 Azzie :  You have to understand though, im looking for the stats people want to see in hosting, as in I ran apache and got this and then my server and got this.
27468 Waldo *  entered the room.
27475 Azzie :  Good point.
27479 Waldo *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).

27512 Arlie :  Azzie, its nothing available already
27523 Von :  i wonder if vmware will solve my issue with having to run windows apps to access web based email with my isp
27532 Edwina :  anybody know where the fix is for the Flash bug that causes menus to pop up behind the flash clip?
27534 Azzie :  I believe i saw some type of /dev/epoll patch
27543 Arlie :  Azzie, /dev/epoll is old
27546 Eustolia :  Von, why are you having issues with accessing email?
27546 Azzie :  Although now its a syscall so i doubt that would help.
27551 Gale :  MrParanoia: you don't need windows to access web based email
27556 Eustolia :  Von, use FF and it works fine.
27575 Gale :  you could also use a client that supports pop3
27591 Von :  Gale: firefox 2.x running on linux doesn't work but does on windows
27598 Winston *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
27600 Eustolia :  Von, it works for me.

27626 Dolly *  wonders why every "non-functional" piece of Open Source software works without flaw on his computer.
27628 Rueben :  MrParanoia, if the webmail specificly requires you to use anything..  Make your normal browser claim it is that browser :)
27630 Collin *  entered the room.
27643 Von :  and tech support won't talk to me about
27646 Arlie :  Azzie, part of the problem with making a fast webserver, is that your dealing with small files and large files, and you cant treat them the same
27652 Eustolia :  Von, get a different ISP.
27655 Leisa *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
27658 Edwina :  tech support are idiots
27666 Eustolia :  This one ISP helped me trouble shoot kmail :D
27674 Edwina :  that is like going to McDonalds for questions about NASA architecture
27684 Arlie :  Azzie, which means any real test, of the server itself, and not of the individual parts, has to come from a real website using real traffic patterns
27692 Von :  i'll try raising some hell with my isp when i get back home
27698 Faustino *  entered the room.
27708 Von :  embarq is my isp
27713 Arlie :  Azzie, you can get traces of websites for testing, the world cup soccer website is one of them ... its 3 months of actual logs from the 1998 world cup soccer website
27720 Eustolia :  Comcast is my isp.
27744 Azzie :  Hrm
27744 Eustolia :  Using Comcast is like streaking... you go fast but everyone can see your most private parts.

27762 Rueben :  Edwina, naa..  That's not fair..  I mean..  whoever working in McD COULD know something about NASA architecture as a sort of hobby or something ;)
27771 Eustolia :  Von, use gmail and googletalk.

27838 Gail *  entered the room.
27868 Rueben :  Eustolia, my point was that tech support usually knows less about computers than a McD employe knows about Nasa arch :)
27886 Eustolia :  Rueben, and realistically: a dude working in McD is more likely to know astrophysics than an ISP tech to know anything about computers.
27915 Marlin *  entered the room.
27925 Francoise *  entered the room.
27945 Von :  konquerer won't log into any part of myembarq.com
27948 Rueben :  Naa..  Georgia guys working at tech usually knows what they're doing..  We just never get to talk to anyone even remotely close to such a position :)
27963 Lamonica *  left the room.
27968 Azzie :  Although there are some reasons you would want to work at an isp as a tech savvy person.
27991 Marlin :  Is there a way to remove embedded artwork from music files? Amarok isn't transferring them to my iPod correctly (they're all just blank), and it's making the info display kinda ugly.
28004 Collin *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
28012 Arlie :  Azzie, http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/WorldCup.html
28017 Collin *  entered the room.
28025 Lianne *  entered the room.
28035 Collin :  hi
28036 Lianne :  evening y'all
28037 Renaldo *  entered the room.
28040 Renaldo :  how can I either (a) get Thunderbird windows and Thunderbird linux sharing the same data/config files on a machine or network  or (b) get Thunderbird linux to import from Thunderbird windows?
28049 Arlie :  Azzie, i started working on a distributed test client, that would read those traces, and hammer the webserver ... just never finished it
28061 Collin :  for some reason, my memory & swap usage is gradually increasing,
28062 Lianne :  hey gregoh
28071 Renaldo :  Collin: memmy leakage
28076 Priscila :  Collin: using firefox?
28076 Von :  i never have been impressed by sprint or embarq (an offshoot of sprint) tech support
28087 Arlie :  Azzie, you have to stop the timer, read some trace data, start the timer again, request the data, stop the timer, etc... its not trivial
28090 Collin :  but the sum of the memory usage used by all the processes in gnome-system-monitor is much less than what free shows
28105 Verdie *  entered the room.
28105 Carry *  entered the room.
28106 Collin :  Priscila, yes
28109 Tasia :  Diff question: Is there a way to diff the output of two commands without writing that output to files?
28111 Gretchen *  entered the room.
28120 Von :  i think i'll go have a drink
28124 Fatimah *  entered the room.
28124 Priscila :  Tasia: if you use bash, yes.
28125 Arlie :  Azzie, plus the traces are screwed up
28128 Nelson *  left the room (quit: "Rhodium detected!  Where is my toad?").
28131 Gretchen :  how do i make it so a regular user can use the reboot
28133 Collin :  but according to gnome-system-monitor, firefox only uses 131MB
28136 Arlie :  Azzie, they are "mostly good" ;)
28142 Darline *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
28148 Priscila :  Tasia: diff <(command) <(command)
28158 Marlin :  Anyone know of a related utility?
28170 Collin :  Gretchen, do you know how to use sudo?
28176 Tasia :  Priscila: So that's what < does! thanks!
28191 Gretchen :  Collin:  not really
28195 Priscila :  Tasia: nope, < and <() are VERY different :)
28201 Azzie :  Arlie: wow
28203 Gretchen :  i have it installed
28215 Carry *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
28224 Azzie :  Arlie: good deal, thanks for the link
28227 Collin :  Gretchen, type "sudo visudo" at the command line, and then enter your password
28229 Collin :  it will bring you to an editor
28236 Tasia :  Priscila: Would this be covered in the ABS guide?
28237 Arnetta *  entered the room.
28240 Della *  entered the room.
28289 Arlie :  Azzie, then theres the issue of calculating the load based on the trace data
28301 Lianne :  Has anyone here used MKS integrity?
28302 Gretchen :  Collin:  ok im here
28308 Arnetta *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
28311 Arlie :  Azzie, since your server isnt the same hardware/software as their server, and the traces are the actuall request logs
28320 Drucilla *  entered the room.
28327 Fredric *  entered the room.
28329 Collin :  Gretchen, and at the bottom of the file, add a line saying "username ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/init 6
28331 Drucilla :  anyone use elinks with x11 support?
28339 Collin :  (without the quote)
28344 Della *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
28355 Lillie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
28356 Arlie :  Azzie, but for your own purposes, its good enough to simply "request" the same files, 1 after the other, and time it, thereby, simulating the same sequence of requests, albeit in a time compressed full load manner
28358 Drucilla :  i compiled it with x and color support, but i don't know how to run it with either
28359 Fredric :  can someone answer a question. is redraw under x a gpu or cpu issue?
28359 Dexter *  entered the room.
28365 Priscila :  Tasia: Dunno, never read it.
28369 Arnetta *  entered the room.
28369 Fredric :  please
28372 Collin :  then the username user can rebooot with "sudo /sbin/init 6"
28374 Lianne :  Im looking for a tool that shows the difference between two files (similar to vimdiff, but a little more colourful/verbose), something i can use to create pdfs and send off to Q&A
28390 Demetrius :  hey folks... I'm trying to learn more about fuse or mounting a voulme via ssh...
28402 Arlie :  Azzie, and you cant do it from the same box of course ... so that means a gigabit network with multiple clients for a real test
28405 Azzie :  Arlie: For now its goode enough, I mostly want it so I can tell what mods are faster as well.
28409 Drucilla :  i though it would be like links with a -g option
28413 Demetrius :  basic problem is that I need to use a "key file" on a remote box without that file ever leaving that bos
28417 Demetrius :  s/bos/box
28420 Azzie :  I do have a gigabit lan to a server
28425 Demetrius :  is that something that I can do with fuse and ssh
28431 Azzie :  actually, I could have two clients if i use my laptop
28435 Demetrius :  Arlie, you should remember this problem :)
28442 Arlie :  Demetrius, what problem ?
28443 Tasia :  Priscila: In that case, how are < and <() different? Is it more than < reading a file, and <(foo) redirecting stdout from foo?
28443 Fredric :  come on. someone has got to know?
28446 Collin :  Fredric, I think it is CPU unless you have hardware acceleration set up
28454 Mercy *  entered the room.
28456 Fredric :  THANK YOU
28473 Gretchen :  Collin:  i got an error
28474 Demetrius :  Arlie, remember my encrypted backup dilemma?
28477 Arlie :  Demetrius, theres support in the kernel for a mounted key filesystem
28489 Arlie :  Demetrius, or something like that, i saw it last night
28492 Sharlene *  entered the room.
28497 Gretchen :  undeclared runas alias ROOT
28499 Fredric :  i appreciate the answer. thanks
28501 Drucilla *  left the room.
28509 Sharlene :  What does "Route 2, PO Box 188" mean?
28523 Sharlene :  I get the PO BOX 188 part
28524 Carol *  entered the room.
28529 Demetrius :  Sharlene, means you are connected to West Virginia
28534 Priscila :  Tasia: man bash , "Process Substitution" section
28536 Collin :  hmm
28536 Collin :  did you type root all lowercase+?
28560 Cory *  entered the room.
28573 Mercy *  left the room.
28575 Gretchen :  Collin:  i just did now and now the error went away
28584 Gretchen :  Collin:  now on this user i can run 'reboot' ?
28594 Tasia :  Priscila: Ah, okay, so they are completely different.
28607 Julieann *  entered the room.
28649 Gretchen :  Collin:  or i have to sudo then reboot
28685 Priscila :  Tasia: Yes.
28708 Priscila :  Tasia: If they were not, there would be no reason to have seperate syntax!
28772 Raquel *  left the room (quit: "head just banged on the keyboard").
28776 Tasia :  Priscila: Touche.
28784 Priscila :  I will not touch you.
28792 Gia *  entered the room.
28793 Tasia :  :)
28798 Collin :  Gretchen, you have to use "sudo /sbin/init 6" and you won't need a password for that
28812 Collin :  but you can make it shorter using an alias
28830 Mirella *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
28834 Gretchen :  Collin:  so if i put this in my menu file
28836 Von *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
28838 Gretchen :  for my moms account
28843 Gretchen :  and just label it shutdown
28845 Gretchen :  then that will work
28848 Collin :  yeah
28849 Gretchen :  it will just shutdown
28851 Gretchen :  ok cool
28852 Fredric *  left the room ("Leaving").
28868 Gretchen :  Collin:  i had one last question, whats the most effective way so when the user logs in
28870 Collin :  you might want to test it, though
28873 Gretchen :  'startx' runs automatically
28885 Signe *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
28899 Domitila *  entered the room.
28919 Domitila :  good afternoon
28931 Darwin *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

29191 Jenae *  entered the room.
29211 Jenae :  How does Puppy Linux compare to DeLi Linux?
29213 Shawnee *  left the room ("WeeChat 0.2.4").
29231 Domitila :  I haven't used either, but I have used DSL
29236 Melda :  Gretchen: runlevel 4/5
29237 Assunta *  entered the room.
29239 Charlyn *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
29242 Assunta *  is now known as Assunta
29243 Domitila :  and I thought DSL was awesome, so if I were you, I'd not completely disregard it Jenae
29246 Kaci :  wtf does "
29246 Kaci :  fs sa rlidwka" mean
29262 Domitila :  oh btw darwin, is your SN having anything to do with Apple's Darwin?
29266 Jenae :  I like IceWM better than Fluxbox
29281 Domitila :  ahh well that would be a good reason not to use DSL I guess
29281 Buffy *  left the room (quit: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)).
29285 Domitila :  I haven't used IceWM myself
29300 Priscila :  dwm is the best window manager ever.
29317 Becki :  I like icewm.
29321 Jodie *  hates all window managers to some extent
29326 Domitila :  both open source and proprietary
29332 Domitila :  I have yet to see a GUI that I absolutely loved
29355 Domitila :  for that matter, I also dislike the CLI
29355 Verdie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
29356 Eustolia :  Domitila, I empathize with you.
29359 Domitila :  I wonder why I even use computers :-P
29364 Domitila :  except I love them
29371 Eustolia :  There is always some unnecessary compromise.
29379 Domitila :  the only UI I've seen that I liked actually, it wasn't an OS GUI at all, it's the GUI for Alias Sketchbook Pro
29385 Domitila :  also Opera's GUI I personally love
29390 Domitila :  and the Wii UI is awesome
29396 Domitila :  so those are three examples of UIs that I like
29399 Melda :  Domitila: enlightenment &&/or ratpoison
29400 Eustolia :  Domitila, you are incoherent, I retract the second statement from the most recent. Have a nice day.
29415 Priscila :  how can you use && , && ! || ?
29425 Gail *  entered the room.
29438 Eustolia :  Priscila, in what language/
29441 Eustolia :  Priscila, in bash?
29443 Domitila :  I've tried Enlightenment, it drove me crazy :(
29446 Velda *  entered the room.
29448 Eustolia :  Priscila, in Java?
29452 Domitila :  It was a big dissappointment, as I had really thought it would be an awesome UI
29460 Priscila :  Eustolia: "Melda | Domitila: enlightenment &&/or ratpoison"
29460 Olive *  is now known as Olive
29478 Collin :  && runs the command after it only if the previous command was successful
29491 Maple *  left the room (quit: Success).
29505 Domitila :  ratpoison I have not seen, but it does not inspire that much confidence
29507 Melda :  goldish: que?
29509 Lianne :  && will run the next command only if the first returns 0;
29514 Eustolia :  & forks, ; executes regardless if the previous statement was successful.
29517 Collin :  || runs the command only if the previous one was unsuccessful
29519 Domitila :  err, the name does not
29535 Priscila :  Melda: I was just commenting you used && then or, instead of || :) Nevermind.
29540 Lianne :  1&2 is a totally different thing too
29540 Oleta *  entered the room.
29546 Lianne :  (just adding to the confusion)
29548 Melda :  goldfish it was perfectly proper
29556 Priscila :  I know.
29558 Santo :  guutgawd o.o
29560 Melda :  :-p
29563 Priscila :  Forget it!
29569 Collin :  I find it useful to chain a series of commands together with &&
29576 Santo :  i need kitty
29577 Oleta *  left the room.
29583 Madie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).

29619 Kenneth *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
29630 Charlyn *  entered the room.
29634 Velda :  Georgia way I understand it, backup-wise, linux files are just windows files without mandatory locking on by default
29648 Velda :  Would that be correct?
29665 Azzie :  Linux files aren't windows anything.
29668 Santo :  Yeah.
29669 Whitney *  entered the room.
29670 Santo :  That confused me.
29671 Hellen *  smacks Velda on the head with a frozen trout
29675 Bettyann *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
29690 Santo :  We're not sure what you're trying to ask, Velda.
29697 Santo :  Files are files.  They contain binary or ascii data.
29710 Santo :  Georgia main difference is that a UNIX system does not rely on file extensions, like Windows does.
29710 Velda :  Really, I'm asking about backups and locking
29713 Rachel :  , linux files are just windows files without the kangaroo and the banana cream pie.
29721 Darline *  entered the room.
29723 Ike *  somehow feels a patronizing baited question coming
29724 Bettyann *  entered the room.
29736 Sharlene :  mmm banana cream
29750 Santo :  Are you trying to ask how to back up files in Linux?
29760 Daphne *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
29769 Velda :  I'm asking how to *safely* backup files in linux
29775 Azzie :  Copy them
29775 Rachel :  Velda: Which "mandatory locking" system call in Windows are you referring to?
29776 Gale :  tar
29778 Azzie :  tar
29778 Gale :  or cp -a
29779 Melda :  Velda: don't compare the two, either ask a question or get going
29780 Daphne *  entered the room.
29786 Whitney :  if i want to do an echo in an sh script, how do i allow multiple lines?
29791 Velda :  savetheworld, CreateFile
29791 Melda :  Velda: on the same machine or from windows to linux?
29794 Kaci :  Who took AP COMPSCI
29799 Azzie :  tar is the backupmaster - hence tape archive
29800 Eustolia :  Santo, actually, there is more to UNIX files than that: there's also the end-of-file character which is different than Windows.
29801 Ronda *  entered the room.
29809 Ronda *  left the room.
29810 Rachel :  Velda: are you worried about the file being changed while you a re copying it? like a database?
29811 Lianne :  Velda, rsync -a --progress /my/really/important/folder /my/back/up/folder/
29813 Melda :  Whitney: echo "this is the echo (press enter) this is still the echo"
29813 Gia :  Velda: linux doesn't suffer from the annoyances of file locks like that. you can back up a running system in it's enirety
29814 Orlando *  left the room (quit: "<Ashley> im pretty sure only a woman would be capable of the sort of mental torture required to get a man to chop his dong of).
29818 Velda :  yes, savetheworld
29819 Gale :  yeah, I personally feel tar is the way to go too
29822 Laurene :  2.6.21.2 is out
29824 Santo :  Eustolia: That I did not know.  Can you elaborate/link?
29824 Eustolia :  Santo, there's also encodings which cause odd characters to pop up every here and there.
29828 Mitzie *  entered the room.
29835 Gia :  yup. compiling it right now
29839 Josephina *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
29839 Eustolia :  Santo, the EOF character is actually different... there really is no elaboration.
29841 Ahmed :  is there a liveCD of arch
29844 Chandra :  Velda: lvm2 has a snapshot mode, but even with that you should remount the filesystem read-only before taking one if you need files to be in a consistent state
29858 Eustolia :  Santo, also every object is a file, just about.
29862 Josephina *  entered the room.
29862 Velda :  Chandra, thats what I wanted to know
29865 Whitney :  Melda - oh, simple enough - thanks a lot!
29869 Santo :  Eustolia: You mean the very last character in the file?
29876 Eustolia :  Santo, yes.
29880 Rachel :  Velda: In order to prevent that yo uhave to shut down the application that might change the file.  Then copy (backup) the file, then restart the app.
29884 Eustolia :  Santo, there's a special character than denotes EOF.
29887 Santo :  Eustolia: Ah, that meant how it read.
29891 Melda :  Whitney: and if no tin a script just in a shell, end the line with "\" before pressing enter to go onto the next line
29903 Gia :  Velda: personally i keep full system backups (with obvious stuff like /dev and /mnt excluded) via rsync on a seperate disk. the first pass just copies everything, the second updates new items and removes old items. if you want incrimental backups, use rdiff-backup in the same way
29906 Eustolia :  Santo, this character is special in that if it appears, the operating system knows that's the end of the file.
29911 Whitney :  Melda - i was trying it that way,a ctually, it just merged it all together
29915 Santo :  Eustolia: Ooh, interesting.  I always had a thing for file structure.  I was always fascinated by the tape backup unit I had for my Sinclair Spectrum ZX.
29920 Florrie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
29926 Santo :  Eustolia: Awesome!  Learn something new every day.
29929 Rachel :  Chandra's remount ro trick will also work.  if your partitions are nicely placed to allow that
29940 Sondra *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
29941 Gia :  rsync and rdiff-backup can both work over a network as well.
29947 Melda :  Whitney: you can also do it all in one line using the "\n" "newline" character that echo takes - i believe it's in echoes manfiles, etc

30028 Macy *  entered the room.
30036 Whitney :  Melda - root@compass -> echo line one\
30036 Whitney :  > \n new line
30040 Whitney :  that outputs to one line =(
30045 Gretchen *  left the room (quit: "leaving").
30071 Priscila :  echo -e, printf, although you probably want a here document.
30072 Chandra :  Whitney: echo -e
30073 Lianne :  Whitney, echo -e
30080 Lianne :  quick draw!!!
30089 Demetrius *  left the room (quit: "This computer has gone to sleep").
30098 Whitney :  o.O
30116 Whitney :  root@compass -> echo -e line one\

30119 Whitney :  same result =(
30214 Chandra :  Whitney: echo -e 'line 1\nline 2' works for me

30702 Lakenya :  "kill all the stupid people, then we will be free"
30703 Rosette :  thats it, im throwing my win cd out the window. Did a complete reinstall on my other box, got all the updates, now its in a bsod reboot loop. I give up

30753 Sharlene :  Arlie: wait a second...  the organic matter produces more hydrogen ions.. acidity++;  but if you add lime...doesn't that also acidity++...?
30754 Arlie :  Laurene, i admit, its rather geeky, but if you know what lime does to rotting bodies, its funny ;)

30768 Sharlene :  Don't we want acidity--?
30770 Laurene :  Arlie: I was suspecing something of that kind

30848 Arlie :  anyway, its common for gardeners to add lime to soil, or lawns
30872 Sharlene :  and the high acidity pH acts as an enzyme that speeds up the process of organic decomposition much like fungi.
30886 Madison :  ey y
30894 Arlie :  Sharlene, if you say so ;)
30903 Madison :  when i try to run my configurue script it says permission denied
30943 Sharlene :  sudo chown YouruserName -R .

31058 Sharlene :  sudo su
31059 Sharlene :  visudo
31061 Sharlene :  Then add this line:    YourUserName ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL
31092 Lianne :  sudo su? hahaha
31096 Priscila :  lol.
31103 Lianne :  sudo -i please next time Sharlene

31156 Cary *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
31158 Angla :  Sharlene: i'm not convinced by the line in /etc/sudoers either
31181 Madison :  wtf
31194 Madison :  whats the easiest way to gain permission of this file ?
31200 Emilia :  yeesh,  memtest86+ gives me hundreds of "errors" and going on 2000 "ecc errors"...
31203 Rosette :  sudo line looked very ubuntu-ish
31213 Maragret *  entered the room.
31226 Angla :  Sharlene: YourUserName ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
31230 Angla :  ?
31237 Maragret :  I'm just wondering, does most hardware contain a random number generator? does /dev/random use this random number generator?
31245 Gail *  left the room (quit: ).
31257 Lianne *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
31262 Sharlene :  Emilia: what does the first error say?
31274 Emilia :  Sharlene: i just rebooted - i don't recall
31280 Santo :  I was under the impression that the kernel generated a random seed file at startup.
31298 Angla :  Sharlene: er clarification pls
31312 Sharlene :  Emilia: I've had the same problem in the past.  That sounds like the RAM is bad. lol
31344 Emilia :  i would say so.  i'm going to try reseating it and run the test agaon
31352 Santo :  also make sure the contacts are clean
31358 Elaine *  entered the room.
31359 Sharlene :  Rosette: What does your sudo file look like? :]
31371 Rosette :  i dont use sudo
31372 Santo :  mine's 8"
31375 Sharlene :  Angla: what exactly is wrong with the line?
31381 Emilia :  those high-quality ebay 1GB memory modules
31383 Sharlene :  Rosette: you use 'su'?
31391 Carson *  entered the room.

31417 Myrtis :  Priscila um, yes it is
31420 Rosette :  i usually use this machine for productivity, in the few times I do need root access, yes, I su

31444 Benny *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).

31454 Dayle *  entered the room.
31459 Rosette :  i quit tinkerning about four years ago
31463 Myrtis :  pseudorandom if you want to be pedantic, but it's based on random data
31466 Sharlene :  Emilia: sometimes those RAM guys make mistakes.  I sent away from RAM one time and when I got it the first time it was the wrong brand.  Georgia second time I had 100+ RAM errors.  Georgia third time they finally sent the right one...and tested it before sending!
31473 Arlie :  no
31480 Jenae :  MrWGW: Don't you dare suggest that!!! I hate Apple!!!
31490 Rachel :  cat /dev/pedantic > Myrtis
31494 Sharlene :  Emilia: make sure your Motherboard accepts ECC RAM.  Otherwise it won't work.
31497 Melda :  I use sudo on all my linux machines because i have root access completely disabled so that even if anything ever is somehow compromised the damage stays maintained
31499 Collin :  I want some RAM with a radioactive casing
31500 Arlie :  /dev/random is random data ... based on system events, like mouse movements, or hardware random number generators, if you enabled it in the kernel
31500 Collin :  :D
31513 Madison :  so how can i set the permission of my configure.ac file ? :P
31523 Arlie :  and mouse movements are random as far as predictability is concerned
31531 Daryl *  entered the room.
31532 Sharlene :  Angla: hmmm...  Georgia '(root)' part seems to work ok for me.  I suppose both of our sudo lines means the same thing.
31553 Arlie :  /dev/urandom is pseudo-random, because it will fall back to an algorithm if the kernel runs out of entropy
31553 Melda :  Arlie: so it's not the theory of an infinity of random monkeys pounding on random keyboards to eventually recreate all the works of shakespeare?
31566 Alexis *  entered the room.
31587 Arlie :  Melda, um ... what do you think ?
31589 Melda :  i mean, one day my /dev/random was the introduction of macbeth
31596 Arlie :  Melda, it could be
31603 Myrtis :  could it really be? :)
31608 Melda :  okay, just as long as I have the shelter of "could be"
31612 Ahmed :  hi
31612 Alexis :  how do i see a list of hardware (harddrives, cd/rom, etc...?)
31612 Melda :  :)
31618 Daryl :  I'm going to do something unthinkable. I'm going to give someone an SSH account on my server. What is the best method to ensure the SSH account can't be misused? Disabling compilers, chrooting, etc. Using something like JailKit to do an all round lockin for that user to a single directory? :)
31619 Cristina *  left the room (quit: "Download Gaim: http://gaim.sourceforge.net/").
31621 Rachel :  Myrtis: yes.  Do you wanna wait till it hapopens? :-)
31622 Maragret :  you mean with the three witches?
31624 Maragret :  thats whack
31635 Ahmed :  where are all the good channels
31636 Arlie :  Daryl, a virtual server
31639 Myrtis :  Rachel I mean, the algorithm might not be able to generate that
31645 Benny *  entered the room.
31649 Collin :  Daryl, it helps if you trust the user, somewhat
31653 Melda :  Daryl: chroot/jail - or a VE ;)
31654 Rachel :  Myrtis: if its random it can generate anything.
31657 Daryl :  Arlie: my knowledge isn't that great, I think that'd probably be over my head. :(
31658 Ahmed :  where there are people
31668 Myrtis :  Ahmed /server 127.32.4.128  - secret place where all the good channels are
31670 Daryl :  Collin: I do... but I don't trust that might not screw up by accident sometime, too :P
31675 Gale :  classic, a guy named darwin that hates apple lol
31675 Melda :  Daryl: ...why does someone randomnly need an account
31680 Arlie :  Daryl, you asked for the best method ... best methods are rarely the most common or comprehensible ;)
31688 Daryl :  Arlie: fair point :D
31693 Rachel :  Myrtis: if there is some sequence the algorithn can't generate, then it is distinctly not random.
31700 Ahmed :  probly a trap
31702 Santo :  ^_^_^_^
31710 Santo :  subnet 127.* IP's are local
31713 Gale *  is now known as Gale
31713 Arlie :  Rachel, theres no sequence it cant generate
31714 Myrtis :  Daryl grsecurity has some nice options for public computers
31717 Kandra *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
31719 Daryl :  Melda: the site they run has IRC and shoutcast. I set it up originally, but I figure I trust them enough to edit some configuration files when they need to
31723 Gale :  I hate Microsoft!!
31725 Rachel :  Arlie: I'm aware.
31729 Emilia :  me too!
31737 Gale *  is now known as Gale
31747 Arlie :  another method to get good random bits is to record them from your sound card
31753 Daryl :  Thanks Myrtis, I'll check it out too
31759 Maragret *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
31759 Arlie :  just record the hiss
31759 Sharlene :  Melda: oh cool.  I like your disable root technique.
31760 Emilia :  errors galore still
31770 Alexis :  anyone?
31796 Arlie :  Gale, microsoft sucks and they smell like cheap cologne !
31810 Berna *  entered the room.
31823 Lakenya :  Arlie: get a webcam tape over the lens, randomness from the semiconductors :)
31830 Gale :  this one guy I used to know that worked for Microsoft said that Bill Gates gives off a bad odor
31833 Sharlene :  Melda: but wait...what if someone takes over your regular account and then uses `sudo`?  Isn't that equivalent to someone taking over the root account?
31838 Arlie :  Lakenya, it might just give you black
31839 Melda :  Sharlene: it's pretty standard on most "big" servers
31843 Berna :  How can I upgrade my forcedeth from 0.56 to 0.60?
31848 Melda :  Sharlene: not if my regular account can't do everything
31860 Epifania *  is now known as Epifania
31860 Myrtis :  so how do YOU do everything
31862 Gale :  Sharlene: essentially
31865 Berna :  this is a nvidia network interface driver.
31866 Arlie :  Gale, he gives out bad software with viruses ... bad odor isnt hard to imagine
31870 Santo :  oh god i have no energy
31872 Melda :  Sharlene: if i "really" need root access I can always single my machine - or have different users have different sudo accessibilities
31872 Santo :  i have to eat something :(
31887 Berna :  can anyone help-me with this?
31888 Avery *  entered the room.
31891 Melda :  Gale: he does look like he'd smell like mothballs, no?
31916 Gale :  I was thinking he smelled like bacon
31923 Santo :  Berna: what distro?
31926 Daryl :  I sort of like the smell of moth balls, does that make me weird?
31930 Berna :  opensuse 10.2
31930 Jenae *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
31942 Santo :  Berna: can you use YaST to do that?
31945 Berna :  I have the rpm package for version 10.0. But I haven't package fo 10.2.
31951 Melda :  Sharlene: but otherwise, yes, it is still dangerous - but someone knowing to break into account "akjfia" to use root controls is just another "layer" to make it take them that extra 10 seconds to break in ;)
31957 Berna :  probably not. I don't know.
31968 Emilia :  i pulled out a pair of memory modules and no errors yet
31975 Santo :  Berna: I can't help you.
31978 Collin :  Gale, was it brimstone?
31978 Collin :  :P
31983 Arlie :  im gonna challenge people to hack my server soon
31988 Santo :  Arlie: me!
31988 Berna :  my actual version is 0.56.
31990 Margarette *  left the room (quit: ).
31990 Arlie :  you cant do it ;)
31991 Gale :  that might have been it
31993 Avery *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
31999 Santo :  Are you running a BSD, Arlie?
32000 Berna :  how can I upgrade a kernel module?
32000 Avery *  entered the room.
32004 Melda :  Emilia: like actually ripped them off the RAM? (or are you talking about something else?)
32014 Arlie :  Santo, no ... its a message passing tcp server
32025 Berna :  I have the new version source.
32029 Gale :  that weird kind of bacony smell, not the normal bacony smell that makes you hungy, but the kind that makes you want to heave
32033 Emilia :  i took out two of four sticks
32034 Avery *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
32039 Sharlene :  Melda: that 10 seconds can mean a big difference! lol
32049 Avery *  entered the room.
32054 Arlie :  Gale, like a 10 day old chef salad w/ bacon ?
32058 Gale :  yeah
32069 Melda :  Sharlene: well, if you prefer people to be able to hack your system in three minutes or three and a half minutes - which would you choose?
32085 Cristina *  entered the room.
32086 Gale :  or maybe mothballs and bacon
32093 Gale :  I know
32106 Melda :  Gale: aah, winner.
32115 Sharlene :  Melda: I suppose to make it more difficult would be to create 2500 "dummy accounts" with random hard-to-detect passwords...and the hacker would have to figure out which one has sudo access lol
32117 Gale :  that imitation bacon that isn't Bakos but some strange brand
32117 Avery *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
32121 Arlie :  i want to go to a computer show and shout "your an asshole" when bill gates is speaking
32123 Gale :  like you might see in a dollar store
32133 Avery *  entered the room.
32134 Sharlene :  s/hard-to-detect/hard-to-crack/
32136 Melda :  Sharlene: and which has sudo access to which commands ;)
32141 Rachel :  Arlie: but thats old news.
32148 Arlie :  Rachel, it would be fun tho
32178 Arlie :  not very constructive tho

32202 Avery *  entered the room.
32208 Arlie :  Rachel, no ... thats illegal
32208 Cristina *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).

32238 Ahmed *  left the room.
32245 Azzie :  Arlie: as is benchmarking windows
32254 Santo :  oh wow
32254 Azzie :  Arlie: without their consent
32257 Arlie :  Azzie, im not benchmarking windows
32259 Berna *  left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
32263 Arlie :  Azzie, im benchmarking my webserver
32271 Arlie :  Azzie, theres nothing illegal about it
32274 Santo :  i realize why i have been morbidly depressed all day:  CSS + NO MUSIC + no food today yet
32280 Azzie :  Arlie: Have you read the windows EULA?
32282 Melvina *  turns on music, goes to make food
32288 Arlie :  Azzie, nope, nor will i ever
32304 Azzie :  Im sure it rivals most novels
32314 Arlie :  Azzie, it only applies to people who purchase windows
32319 Santo :  that is true
32325 Judie *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
32334 Sharlene :  Santo: you know Ghandi didn't eat for a long time (called fasting), and he brought peace to a nation!
32336 Azzie :  Arlie: How else are you going to benchmark it?
32338 Arlie :  Azzie, it cant possibly apply to me if i dont purchase windows
32347 Arlie :  Azzie, use someone elses copy
32348 Xochitl *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
32355 Santo :  Sharlene: Ghandi didn't have to make sure his code displays properly in IE6
32358 Azzie :  lol
32371 Cherlyn *  left the room.
32422 Sharlene :  awww.  It looks like you have to hack some CSS.  Good luck :-)
32444 Kathey *  entered the room.
32444 Azzie :  Dont worry about making your site display porperly in IE
32454 Santo :  Sharlene: no, I follow the KISS methodology and refuse to use hacks.
32467 Azzie :  Make it standards complient, if it doesnt dipslay right in IE then make your page display a warning to IE users
32468 Rachel :  Arlie: I'll buy the pie for you.. :-)
32474 Kathey :  is there a way to stop all output to an ssh terminal, without being able to read anything?
32495 Santo :  so i simplified everything by making the majority of the design a PNG i'm incorporating as a background.  1024x768 and 30 KB.  Better than having a slow machine die from having to render borders and stuff.
32503 Kathey :  like if you have a runaway process that is printing too much for you to do anything such as see its pid
32508 Santo :  but then again, how much ram will it need to display a 1024x768 png
32509 Santo :  hmmm
32509 Arlie :  Rachel, the words "benchmark", "performance", or "publish" dont appear in the windows xp home edition eula
32519 Kathey :  and that is a background process
32530 Sharlene :  Santo:  <!--[if IE]><style type="text/css" media="screen"> /* is your friend! */</style><![endif]-->
32535 Azzie :  Well, then.  Do go for it.
32541 Rachel :  Arlie: ok......
32547 Santo :  hehe
32552 Azzie :  Although the fact that windsock blows isnt news
32581 Alexis *  left the room.
32603 Arlie :  its not news to us
32608 Velda *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
32617 Arlie :  but its a loophole that allows you to publish the fact that windows sucks
32633 Angla :  Melda: i hear what you're saying, but i think the extra "protection" might be illusory. while it's true that sudoers is usually mode 440 or something, and thus not readable directly, people could monitor /proc, ps, top or whatever to find out who your trusted sudoers are, and what they can do. you don't have to break in or even try, to get that info quite quickly
32658 Sharlene :  Arlie: "publish the fact that windows sucks" lol :)
32662 Mirella *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).

32799 Veronika *  entered the room.
32830 Sharlene :  Melda, Angla: ahh good ideas.  I suppose the 2500 "dummy" users wouldn't work as well as I had thought.  Just by monitoring the `ps aux`, looking at the current users that are running an xterm, and seeing 'root' processes pop out of nowhere is a very simple clue of who is doing the sudo commands.

33156 Tasha :  Fernando: there's also debian testing.  or debian unstable.
33161 Marylin :  is there anything like wine for mac binaries?
33177 Na :  necesito ayuda en centos pero en espa?ol
33179 Angla :  Madison: the undefined references usually mean an #include or two are missing
33195 Fernando :  Tasha: I was thinking the same thing, and I like ubuntu, but people yell at me and call me a n00buntu :|
33200 Angla :  Madison: or the #include files they refer to
33213 Madison :  so how should i go about finding out ?
33216 Myrtis :  Marylin that would be quite a bit different, wine doesn't actually emulate the processor, for ppc binaries it would have to (newer mac might eventually be different)
33231 Fernando :  Angla: or that you don't have the correct libs in compile agurments

33549 Madison :  sounds real n00bish
33552 Sharyn *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
33558 Angla :  Madison: usually nowhere. you need a make install for that
33572 Myrtis :  Madison usually the same place as the source files
33573 Madison :  that jus take s it and installs it
33577 Madison :  where i it now :P
33583 Maragaret *  left the room.
33595 Myrtis :  install will usually put it in /usr/local/*

33622 Novella *  entered the room.
33625 Novella :  hello
33641 Novella :  is there other software like ephpod for ubuntu?
33656 Jesse :  Novella: did you upgrade yet?
33660 Novella :  ah
33664 Novella :  it is installing right now
33670 Novella :  it has finished downloading the right files
33672 Angla :  Novella: go into synaptic and use the search button

33774 Lorine *  entered the room.
33784 Santo :  Ok, can someone explain to me what the thing is with Linux and things named foo?
33790 Novella :  huh
33809 Santo :  Is it like some inside joke or homage or what?
33816 Darline :  Santo, foo means anything...
33823 Santo :  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo
33824 Santo :  ahh
33828 Rachel *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
33840 Angla :  null: fubar == fscked up beyond all recognition. so you get foo & bar
33848 Jesse :  Santo: foo is the first 'metasyntactic' variable

33972 Jesse :  Shira: fux0red
33973 Angla :  wishbone ash have a track called fubb == fscked up beyond belief
33988 Erik :  I've got framebuffer problems on this laptop. Ubuntu's usplash shows as nothing but a repeating pattern of pixels. That's just an example, though. When Xorg starts, it starts all scrambly, but if I hit ctrl+alt+backspace to restart it once, it loads up just fine. If I restart X again at any point after that, I'm stuck with a black screen and the laptop seems to cease function, much like what happens if I attempt to switch out of
33988 Erik :  X and into a tty console.
33995 Jesse :  wishbone ash? that's a name I haven't heard in a while

34209 Julieann *  entered the room.
34218 Jesse :  Shira: I know it seems incredible, but a plague of 'niceness' is upon us

34260 Ingeborg *  entered the room.
34262 Shalonda :  do you know any IDE to program in GTK?
34265 Shalonda :  any easy stuff
34273 Jesse :  gvim? ;)
34275 Krystina :  i asked that in #suse, but i figured i'd ask in here as well.
34286 Arlie :  Shalonda, glade, but it sucks ;)
34299 Ingeborg :  anybody know an easy way to transfer files between a windows virtual machine's hard drive and my linux hard drive (of which the VM drive is actually a part) ?
34309 Shalonda :  i need do to a GUI to my graph program.
34314 Shalonda :  any suggestions?
34322 Angla :  i found a nasty buglet in ubuntu 7.04 32-bit. it loads up the amd64_agp module for the drm/dri/agp/glx instead of the radeon or whatever agp module. which breaks some things. text in stellarium is broken, and glxgears only goes at 2/3 speed. yuck. short of a recompile, you are stuck
34324 Eustolia :  wazz kitchensync?
34330 Shira :  so it'sok to say suck but not fuck? I never understod that censor stuff, whats the point realy
34331 Arlie :  Shalonda, yes ... custom app framework libs that wrap gtk
34334 Celsa :  Krystina, you should simply stop being a troll
34338 Jesse :  Ingeborg: winscp or somesuch?
34349 Shalonda :  Arlie: what? as in?
34359 Jesse :  Shira: naturally, it's quite arbitrary
34367 Arlie :  Shira, polite society doesnt have sex ... thats an animael behavior and polite society is made up of animals in denial
34380 Arlie :  Shalonda, what what ?
34389 Madison :  when you make something where is the compiled app stored ?
34394 Arlie :  Shalonda, "a custom app framework that wraps gtk"
34405 Shalonda :  im not english, do not understood that..
34409 Shira :  Arlie: id say we are quite polite here, still you can talk quite openly about sex
34409 Shawnee *  entered the room.
34410 Shalonda :  wraps? framework? :o
34418 Ima *  left the room (quit: Nick collision from services.).

34441 Collin *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
34442 Fernando :  when ever I start bluetooth, I get "Can't open RFCOMM control socket: Address family not supported by protocol "
34458 Jesse :  Madison: depends - likely in ./src if such a directory exists
34460 Shira :  Arlie: well yhee, people who is/supports pedos dosent spek it out.. but anything else is ok.
34466 Gina *  entered the room.
34478 Arlie :  Shalonda, yes ... gtk is a widget toolkit ... it doesnt have an "application" object that ties everything together ... you have to make one
34492 Shira :  Arlie: It's eaven legal to have sex in public (as long as noone takes offence)
34494 Jesse :  Madison: sometimes in the top level directory - if nothing else, find will, er, find it
34502 Nicky *  is now known as Nicky
34510 Chun *  left the room (quit: "This computer has gone to sleep").
34511 Becki :  even kinky strap-on sex?  :)
34520 Arlie :  Shalonda, and gtk function calls, to get stuff done, are at times, very verbose and long winded ... hence the need for "wrappers" that take 30 function calls and make them into 1
34541 Madison :  Arlie: i wish there was something better then GTK
34546 Arlie :  Shira, its not legal to have sex in public in the US ... dont know about where your from ;)
34553 Julieann *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
34555 Shira :  Becki: it's popular to be gay here :( It's like 'All cool people are gay" or something..
34560 Adriana :  slacker it's called qT >.>
34564 Shira :  Arlie: sweden
34570 Shalonda :  Arlie: ok. can you tell me where to look for that?
34571 Arlie :  Shira, if its popular, you probably shouldn't be doing it
34572 Krystina :  Celsa:  i'm not spreading fud, i'm asking people to help me get over the fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
34575 Angla :  see, what i ideally want is this : fedora kernel & modules, *apt* for the packages. so it's time for a debhat or fedorian distro ...
34582 Arlie :  Shalonda, you have to make it yourself
34590 Melda :  Angla: apt == yum :-p
34597 Odelia *  entered the room.
34599 Celsa :  yo seinfeld, wazzup
34603 Shira :  Arlie: naa I only do less popular stuff like linux, and animal.. :0p hhehe
34614 Arlie :  Shalonda, there is no automatic application builder rad tool thing for gtk that just runs all by itself ... you have to be a programmer
34639 Arlie :  Shira, animals are smarter than people
34642 Sherell *  entered the room.
34660 Jesse :  Krystina: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/05/18/gpl_microsoft_novell/

34671 Angla :  Melda: yum takes ages. apt is fast as fsck. plus i know how to make a .deb from scratch. rpms take a bit of messing about
34680 Catalina *  left the room ("暫離").
34707 Dia *  highlights Angla 
34710 Shalonda :  Arlie i have 10hours to make a gtk GUI
34711 Shira :  But I find it very strange when looking at american shows when the beep at "fuck" in Ricky Lake, thoes people says alot of harsh things wich makes the "fuck" to seem very silly
34712 Myrna *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
34716 Shalonda :  so it got to be quick
34718 Melda :  Angla: well enough
34720 Shalonda :  glade seems fine
34722 Angla :  Celsa: hi curly
34723 Jesse :  "Statements by the vesuvian Ballmer ", heh
34728 Shalonda :  i only need to read some inputs
34740 Tu *  entered the room.
34740 Celsa :  Angla, hello furry one
34742 Shalonda :  and aply them to my functions, and then show some images
34745 Shira :  Becki: girly wolf? i'm a male tiger =D
34748 Erik :  What is the specific vga= option to disable the framebuffer?
34754 Erik :  vga=normal doesn't seem to do it.
34775 Arlie :  Shalonda, 10 hours ... and you've never used gtk before ?
34785 Arlie :  Shalonda, why such a retarded deadline ?
34792 Arlie :  let me guess ... college
34807 Lina *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").

34853 Erik :  Becki: HOLY SH*T! YOU'RE BACK!
34861 Shalonda :  Arlie: yeah
34862 Shalonda :  :\
34866 Arlie :  Shira, the US is a relatively young country, founded by religious disidents from europe .... give it time ... we'll be saying fuck on tv here too
34871 Shira :  Becki: girly sex between wolves, nice :0p
34892 Madison :  Arlie: i don't think so
34900 Angla :  Arlie: only a damn fool has a gtk main event loop. i've been messing around with gtk in a subsidiary thread. the event loop for me has to be "asynchronous synchronized"
34924 Daryl :  what's weird is every furry I know seems to be gay (or bi). But I'm not disbelieving anyone :D
34927 Penelope *  entered the room.
34927 Arlie :  Angla, a gtk main event loop isnt bad if your running a client app gui thing
34938 Arlie :  Angla, it would be death for a server or i/o intensive app
34939 Jesse :  Daryl: 'furry'?
34949 Shira :  yhee what is US, like 400 years? We have had peace for halfe that time.. We are way beyond war :)
34951 Angla :  Arlie: yeah
34966 Arlie :  Shira, the US is just over 200 years old
34976 Arlie :  Shira, as a nation
34986 Becki :  Erik:  apparantly unregistered people can not message you.
34988 Madison :  first settlement was 400 years ago
35004 Arlinda *  left the room ("Coming Back").
35004 Erik :  Becki: That's a pain. Care to register?
35004 Arlinda *  entered the room.
35005 Madison :  spanish were here over 500
35006 Arlie :  Madison, as a british colony
35007 Shira :  last war ended 1809 here :)
35009 Becki :  not really.
35010 Jesse :  Madison: maybe considerably earlier
35013 Daryl :  Horacio: let me see if  can remember this - people who like to dress up as animals, or roleplay (or even think of themselves) as a cross between humans and animals. animals with human characteristics? Something like that (ie, Sonic or Tails could technically be a furry. They walk, talk like people, etc)
35015 Angla :  Arlie: the idea is that the gtk dialog thread posts requests to the main loop, which processes them once per "cycle"
35019 Madison :  Shira: where you live ?
35024 Shira :  Sweden
35024 Arlie :  fuckin a ... 1776 .... declaration of independance
35031 Jesse :  Daryl: oh, lunatics, ok ;)
35042 Madison :  no one cares about sweden its cold
35043 Daryl :  I try not to judge.. but maybe :D
35043 Priscila :  heh, i just watched the southpark episode on that declaration.
35046 Jarrett *  entered the room.

35058 Shalonda *  left the room (quit: "leaving").
35067 Sheila *  left the room (quit: "Konversation terminated!").
35070 Arlie :  the US as a nation is 230+ odd years old ... not 400 ... not 500
35091 Shira :  Blonde blueeyed bisexuall girls on conventions hugging :)
35092 Madison :  1776 yes
35095 Jesse :  Daryl: as someone poignantly remarked, "I mean, I agree that not everything in this world is as it seems, but a 30-year-old man with a paunch and a hairless pate is not Kilpaf the Dragon-Man from the planet Zilotron with healing ability +5."
35100 Angla :  Arlie: so we are talking shared memory. protected access with pthread_mutex_lock etc
35108 Madison :  conventions ?
35127 Shira :  boardgaming and stuff
35129 Daryl :  Horacio: haha, it's true
35130 Epifania *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
35136 Madison :  board gaming ?
35145 Daryl :  yea, they have conventions where they all go in fursuits and meet up and stuff
35147 Arlie :  Angla, it annoys me to no end, as im sure it does you, that computer systems and operating systems and libraries in general, make high performance the most difficult friggin thing to code ... and they make shitty performance easy
35155 Daryl :  And some of them don't go in fursuits, sure, but it's all about furries.
35155 Ashleigh *  left the room (quit: "WeeChat 0.2.4").

35190 Shira :  Madison: yhee, like Go, Risk, D&D, live roleplaying and stuff
35191 Angla :  Arlie: hallelujah, brother. you can join my choir any time you like
35192 Becki :  Erik:  I'd respond if I could message you.
35200 Erik :  Use /notice
35211 Daryl :  they actually sound vaguely fun. I like the ones with "hug me" on their chest, I'm just half tempted :D
35241 Charlyn *  entered the room.
35243 Shira :  or "touch me" on the chest :)
35244 Novella *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
35252 Daryl :  could be worse :D at least it's not a bondage conventions. Most (All, in fact) furries I've met are pretty harmless :)
35266 Becki :  ... I do believe that's blocked too.
35267 Avery *  entered the room.
35272 Erik :  At least you're not bashing.
35284 Darwin *  entered the room.
35293 Krystina *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
35300 Gertrud :  could anybody give me advice to fsck a ext3 image created with dd?

35340 Alise *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
35342 Arlie :  Madison, in 250 years when miami is underwater and we all live in enviro-bubbles because the suns too damned hot to sustain life, its all anyone is gonna be saying or thinking about ;)
35353 Madison :  lol
35355 Melda :  Melda: err, comedy central* cartoon network... tons of stations
35359 Jaimie *  entered the room.
35362 Shira :  Melda: the word or the act? :)
35366 Madison :  Melda: not in america never heard it once
35387 Daryl :  Erik: heh, I wouldn't bash them. I've really got nothing against it at all even if I probably wouldn't do it :)
35394 Danyel *  left the room (quit: Success).
35398 Melda :  Madison: I live in FL, and i've heard it at least 10 times in the past week. I watch ~an hour or two of TV per day
35409 Angla :  Arlie: mysql. it's easy to use, but slow city. my mythtv database takes *ages* to reindex. you were doing bdb, how does it compare speedwise ?
35411 Madison :  i think its bleeped out some how
35413 Melda :  Madison: granted mostly between 12AM-2AM, but it's definitely out there
35416 Madison :  i live in miami btw
35422 Krystina *  entered the room.
35423 Shira :  like South Park Georgia Movie, age limit 7yo non cencured =D
35436 Madison :  lol just a second ago it was bleeped on the tonight show ;)
35450 Madison :  actually on comedy central yea
35452 Arlie :  Angla, bdb gets as slow as mysql if you try to use it as a generic database
35459 Daryl :  I remember someone in my school took that in, and our science teacher put it on (it was a "fun day"). I think he was alittle shocked eventually :)
35467 Madison :  Melda: im not talking about cable im talking about local
35479 Gale *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
35485 Arlie :  Angla, if your writing a record with a single index to a table, its quite fast
35486 Melda :  Madison: some stations do it, some don't, also depends on the day of the week (kids are more likely to be up on weekends)
35512 Angla :  Arlie: when i was at BT we used informix. i don't know if that is still around, but it was nice and fast
35526 Arlie :  Angla, i think so, and i think its still one of the fastest
35530 Melda :  Madison: well there's only WB - or whatever the fawk it's called now - here as "local" - but it is on TV on select stations etc... was just saying that to prove that it's not "NEVER" going to be allowed in US television
35553 Arlie :  Angla, ibm apparently owns it now

35664 Arlie :  they have titties and fuck words in the US too ... on cable, after 10 or 11pm
35682 Arlie :  just not during the day, and not over the broadcast airwaves
35684 Melda :  actually i've heard fuck more than i've seen nipples

35852 Madison :  they show sex on UK tv ?????/
35855 Priscila :  channel 4 rocks.
35860 Daryl :  It's illegal by UK laws to show an erect penis or something.

35881 Arlie :  Melda, its fine if people want to be gay ... but ... i draw the line at combining gay males getting married at disneyworld ... its a kids park for gods sake
35891 Daryl :  I think it may actually be legal to show an erect penis on non standard channels (ie, PPV)
35904 Collin *  entered the room.
35905 Daryl :  But stuff like Channel 4 that everyone can get without restriction, they're not allowed to.
35916 Madison :  titties and pusssy ?
35918 Daryl :  Course one person argued we should just legalize it, because most people enjoy porno more than violent films.
35934 Jesse :  Daryl: wot, no free cocks?
35940 Daryl :  Madison: yeap, we're allowed that.
35942 Daryl :  Horacio: not hard ones, no
35944 Madison :  wow
35946 Becki :  of course, they have shown strap-on cocks uncensored...
35948 Dayle *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
35952 Madison :  so you can see pussy on tv ?
35957 Madison :  thats crazy
35962 Daryl :  I think so, then again..
35982 Melda :  Arlie: and it would be discriminating to not allow it - anywys, you can't legally be married within the property of disney as it's not in city/county jurisdiction (has their own police/zip/area code) - considering that i live some 5 miles from it i've been there tons and most of the "disney is so gay" stuff is a fucking joke
35982 Arlie :  you guys can have all the tv pussy you want ... its the real thing or nothing for me ... there simply is no substitute
35984 Daryl :  It's probably not legal to show with a view of legs open. I imagine it somehow echos the law with males.
35998 Madison :  stilll
36000 Daryl :  cause they can show non erect penises and stuff.
36009 Madison :  reallly weird
36010 Rochel *  entered the room.
36013 Jesse :  Madison: europe sent most of it's thumping puritans to the 'new world' ;)
36016 Arlie :  Melda, i dont think florida allows "legal" gay marriages anyway, but that doesnt prevent disney from allowing it
36018 Daryl :  which makes me lol. They had the guy with super giant balls on and his ultimate flabby penis.
36018 Melda :  Arlie: aww c'mon, you know you tried to drill a hole in your tv screen
36030 Madison :  now when children start grwing up becoming whores at age 10 we will know why
36034 Daryl :  I have fond memories of "Amsterdam: City of Sin"
36034 Arlie :  Melda, and the whole world is discriminating ... theres nothing wrong with being discriminating
36038 Melda :  Arlie: it does not, not even "civil union" are technically allowed, but having a homosexual governor that may change
36043 Becki :  porn sucks, so it doesn't really matter if it's on tv or not.
36050 Rochel :  to add route to a torrent port at my inter computer (*.99) may i use a rule like this:
36052 Rochel :  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp --dport 6879 -j DNAT --to 10.1.0.99:6879
36053 Rochel :  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p udp --dport 6879 -j DNAT --to 10.1.0.99:6879
36054 Madison :  Daryl: did you get a hooker there ?
36057 Melda :  Arlie: i never said there was - but PC controls more than good-sense
36059 Daryl :  I doubt it's any more "corrupting" than violent.
36060 Arlie :  Melda, its a disney world public ceremony ... i never claimed it was legal ... but its still a marriage
36065 Shira :  an here we have radio shows runing at 13:00 talking about sexual relations and stuff
36069 Shira :  and
36071 Jesse :  Rochel: no - PREROUTING
36075 Donna *  left the room.
36077 Daryl :  Madison: nah, they hookers probably all have HIV or AIDS or something.
36077 Felice *  is now known as Felice
36085 Daryl :  But there was a whole Channel 4 TV series about it when I was younger.
36086 Kandra *  entered the room.
36089 Rochel :  Horacio, whats the diference?
36090 Daryl :  I remember watching it and thinking "Hell yea!"
36094 Daryl :  then my family got the internet.
36099 Arlie :  and i dont want to spend god awful amounts of money, taking my kids to disney world, and watch two fags get married in cinderellas castle
36099 Jesse :  Rochel: one works ;)
36109 Rochel :  ?
36109 Madison :  lol
36121 Lina *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
36124 Melda :  Arlie: then don't watch it... just as you don't have to watch any other two people at the park
36133 Collin *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
36133 Arlie :  Melda, your missing the point
36138 Melda :  Arlie: you act as if there's giant penis-on-penis parages floating around
36142 Jesse :  Rochel: also it is unncessary to specify the --to port if it is the same as the one being forwarded
36148 Arlie :  Melda, there might as well be ... give it time
36150 Melda :  Arlie: if you can't standa what happens in public and in reality, stay out of both
36158 Madison :  society is falling apart
36180 Arlie :  Melda, i mean, if gay men are allowed to get married at disney world ... they should be allows to consumate the marriage right there in front of everyone right ? otherwise, that would be discriminatory
36183 Daryl :  I'll say something really controversial. I don't really care much for "gay marriage". In fact, I know a few gay people who don't actually want to get married as such. They just want to be recognized the same as any other couple in terms of rights. And I don't mind if they get it, I don't see any reason why not, just because it's not "the norm" so to speak.
36183 Melda :  society has always been falling apart - just like how we're all constantly dying - one of those perpetual things ;)
36193 Jarrett *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
36198 Angla :  Horacio: it's worth having a minimalist gui, just to have firestarter. Sheila all this iptables malarkey
36203 Melda :  Arlie: are other people allowed to? no - thus it's not discrimination as the rule applies to EVERYONE
36209 Melda :  perhaps a dictionary would do you well
36209 Arlie :  Melda, sure, and thats why i said, given time, we'll be saying fuck and watching titties on broadcast tv
36222 Arlie :  Melda, no, its discrimination against horny naked people
36233 Madison :  anyways
36239 Madison :  im still censoring it from my children
36239 Arlie :  Melda, i know full well what discrimination is
36242 Jesse :  Angla: dunno, I found iptables doesn't give much trouble, but I haven't tried to do anything very Donna with it
36244 Melda :  Arlie: go rent "idiocracy" - you'd enjoy it i believe - the movie agrees with your theories ;)
36248 Sherry *  left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
36249 Daryl :  I can see the day fuck isn't important if said on TV, actually. Same with "hell", how it used to be "You can't say that on TV?"
36252 Frida *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
36254 Daryl :  now it's everywhere on TV.
36257 Gia *  left the room (quit: ).
36261 Angla :  "worker threads of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your iptables"
36267 Arlie :  Melda, i dont think you understand
36269 Rochel :  Horacio, will this really work?
36270 Rochel :  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 6879 -j DNAT --to 10.1.0.99:6879
36270 Rochel :  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 6879 -j DNAT --to 10.1.0.99:6879
36273 Daryl :  (I have no idea what we're talking about though)
36281 Madison :  fuck i a very strong word im america
36291 Daryl :  It's still a strong word here.
36299 Arlie :  Melda, if you get tossed out of church for shouting "i love satan" ... its because the people in charge of the church, and discriminating against you
36302 Angla :  it's like "liberal". totally taboo on fox
36306 Madison :  well i dont want my 5 year old yellling or hearing fuck
36309 Rochel :  Horacio, how do i remove then later?
36312 Von *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
36312 Daryl :  but it's a culture thing, mroe people do use it these days. "Hell" used to be really strong to use on TV as well, now it doesn't seem to be
36315 Arlie :  Melda, they dont like your behavior, so they have you removed
36315 Jesse :  Rochel: looks like it, offhand - give it a try; you can test it with teh gibs0n
36326 Becki :  personally I think censorship is just plain stupid...  anyone who thinks hearing a word or seeing a nipple on the idiot box should be prevented from breeding.
36326 Daryl :  Madison: honestly, I wouldn't either.
36331 Madison :  hell never had the effect of fuck
36333 Krystina *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
36334 Arlie :  Melda, and im saying, i dont think disney world, a giant park for kids, should have fags getting married in cinderellas castle
36338 Rochel :  gibs0n?
36343 Becki :  anyone who thinks it hurts people, that is
36345 Angla :  grc.com
36350 Arlie :  Melda, because it turns a kids park, into fag heaven
36355 Melda :  Arlie: and you're welcome to that opinion, even if it is ignorant
36375 Arlie :  there is a time and place for everything
36385 Arlie :  and disney world isnt the place for gay sex
36386 Daryl :  Becki: I don't think nudity hurts people as such. I don't think words hurt people either, as such. For words at least, it's about context. Someone angry in your face saying "fuck you" is offense. Someone who says it like it's just another word, well, you barely even notice.
36394 Angla :  Arlie: except french accordion music
36398 Melda :  Arlie: and two men holding hands won't scar your children anymore than hearing your ignorant views on the world
36409 Arlie :  Melda, they arent ignorant
36415 Melda :  Daryl: precisely
36420 Arlie :  Melda, they are simply heterosexual and family oriented
36427 Madison :  Daryl: again i dont want to sit down and watch tv and have my boy or girl see a sex scene ........no big deal
36438 Jesse :  Rochel: the 'shields up!!!' thing - https://grc.com/x/portprobe=6879
36445 Melda :  Arlie: perhaps you should live in rural pennsylvania and stay out of real cities then where the "real world" is
36447 Melda :  lol
36452 Shira :  Madison: maybe if your kid heard and used the fuck word it would understand it's just an word like all others..
36456 Becki :  dunno, disney seems like a perfectly good place to have sex...  you get fun rides, mascots in fursuits,...  much more fun than any of the things people seem to go there for.
36459 Daryl :  Madison: yea, me neither. Context I suppose. If there was something educational with mild nudity, I don't care. Love scenes, or sex, I'd rather not :)
36470 Rochel :  tnx
36470 Arlie :  Melda, if the real world is gay people sucking on each other, its all yours ;)
36473 Madison :  until they are like 15 or 16
36475 Marcel *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
36494 Jesse :  Rochel: try that url, I think that's it; it should say 'stealth' without the rule, 'closed' if your bt client is not running or is msiconfigured, and 'open' if the client is running and using that port
36503 Becki :  now, let's ban religion on tv...  that will actually do something useful.  help prevent mass-brainwashing.
36507 Shira :  Madison: omg, get real.. are you living in the stoneages?
36509 Daryl :  It's just two extremes I suppose. Like the whole "nipple" incident at the superbowl. Yea, it was really low, but I don't think given the situation it was going to scar people. It was just a bit of nipple.
36511 Jaimie *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
36518 Angla :  Arlie: you'd get on well with the survivalists, jew-haters and "patriot" groups
36525 Arlie :  Becki, yes ... i find religion offensive as well
36526 Madison :  Shira: what ?
36534 Arlie :  Angla, no i wouldnt ;)
36535 Melda :  Arlie: lol, have fun then, you better get off this internet thing too - i hear there's a lot of homosexuals and free-thinkers out there on it - you may accidentally run into someone that doesn't completely agree with censorship and the classical right-wing judao-christian views
36537 Daryl :  Doesn't mean it's cool, just... I don't think people need to sue because they're emotionally scarred.
36547 Shiloh *  entered the room.
36551 Jesse :  Shira: it's curious how many people find the portrayal of violence more acceptable than the portrayal of sex
36555 Becki :  as soon as they make it a crime to expose minors to religion, the world will be a better place.
36565 Daryl :  Horacio: that's a fair point :)
36565 Madison :  Horacio: i dont watch violence movies
36567 Melda :  Daryl: the situation with the superbowl didn't scar anyone - replaying it 20,000 times did
36568 Arlie :  Melda, i never claimed you dont have the right to be gay ... go ahead ... be gay ... suck a bunch of dicks ... i dont care ... just dont do it in front of my kids
36582 Jesse :  Madison: I didn't mean you specifically
36585 Daryl :  Melda: it seemed to scar the people who had to sue and cry about it though.
36585 Shira :  Madison: let your children live and learn and have a free will and do no censur them! Thats just harsh!
36586 Melda :  Arlie: then keep your kids away from everyone
36593 Arlie :  Melda, no, just fags like you
36603 Melda :  Arlie: just like if you don't want your kids to see SUV's polluting or anything else rofl
36614 Shawnee *  left the room (quit: "WeeChat 0.2.4").
36615 Melda :  Arlie: my wife, fyi: erinstalent.com
36617 Arlie :  dumb animals
36625 Shiloh :  Is there a way to get a memory dump of 0xF0000000?
36630 Madison :  Arlie: me and you are the only normal ones here
36632 Melda :  but just for you i'll reserve a gay-blowjob for when your kids are in town rofl
36649 Arlie :  Melda, you'll be blowing smith and wesson
36655 Madison :  lol
36655 Emilia :  so how unreliable is nfs?
36655 Melda :  hahahah
36658 Melda :  mmk lkiddo
36669 Darline *  left the room (quit: "Ex-Chat").
36673 Becki :  Arlie:  worried your kids might be exposed to the real world, options that might consider, and things many millions of people do?
36680 Arlie :  Becki, not at all
36683 Madison :  this is not the real world
36691 Arlie :  Becki, i simply made the point that disney world is for kids
36695 Melda :  so let's see... as an internat badass you've thus proven that you're a homophobe, want to censor everything your children and everyone else see... and umm, you're basically another right-wing fucktard
36698 Daryl :  I don't think any gay person is going to suck another person off in front of anyone. I think seeing gay people holding hands is really going to cloud their judgement any. Either the innocent mind will see them as good friends, or they'll already seem to have a vague idea of love between two people. Besides, I don't think seeing something as any real influence. I don't see gay people and think "I want to do that too".
36701 Shiloh *  left the room.
36711 Jesse :  Madison: what's not real? irc? say it's not so!
36711 Daryl :  And I go to any theme park, and I see men and women eating each others face. I don't want to see that either.
36716 Shira :  Swe: Dad explains to his 12yo son about flowers and bees "Well, you know thoes films I know you been watching on the internet, where a man fcuks around with alot of different girls. Well bees and flowers does that too." :D
36719 Daryl :  Cause it's for kids, and honestly, it's ugly. In either gender.
36722 Arlie :  Becki, if disney world wants to stop being for kids, and turn itself into gay love fest ... thats fine ... its their business ... but i wont be there with my kids .... they are seperate world
36724 Arlie :  s
36730 Jesse :  Shira: heh
36737 Becki :  sure disney is for kids...  they can sell Hello Kitty vibrators in the gift shop if they want to.
36744 Porsche *  entered the room.
36745 Arlie :  Becki, and most people would agree with me ... as most people would agree its not cool to take your kids to a gay bath house either
36746 Rebekah *  entered the room.
36754 Melda :  Daryl: precisely. hertero couples fucking in public is just as bad... people seem to think that all gay people ar econstantly butt-fucking as they walk or something
36765 Jesse :  Melda: heh
36767 Becki :  most people are stupider than a box of bricks, as I believe you agreed with me on in a previous conversation.
36768 Angla :  Emilia: nfs is ok. it depends on the temperature, humidity and wind direction tho. don't be expecting to fill your ethernet pipe wall to wall tho
36779 Melda :  Arlie: and they appreciat eyou staying the fuck away
36788 Arlie :  Melda, gladly
36802 Madison :  Arlie: 90 percent of these irc people are deprived far left wing indiiduals ......... i thought we already established this ??
36803 Dexter :  anyone here good with icecast?
36814 Daryl :  I've felt extremely unconfortable standing in a queue and having to watch two people share a lovely tonguey kiss in front of me. And that was a hetro couple. And I've seen it more than once.
36816 Melda :  k, so we've aggreed, you can live in your censored box in pennsylvania and pray and ride a buggy... are you allowed to be using power?
36820 Bruno *  entered the room.
36823 Rebekah :  hey guys whats the best partition manager in gnome ?
36831 Kelvin *  left the room (quit: Connection reset by Brandie).
36831 Porsche *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
36841 Rochel :  Horacio, i dont have to restart any service, right?
36852 Jesse :  Rochel: 'service'?
36855 Emilia :  all i'm expecting is that my irreplaceable photos are still there when i reboot
36855 Rochel :  Rebekah, gParted, or QTparted
36857 Arlie :  Melda, dont get your panties in such a wad fag boy ... i said i didnt think disney world should be promoting and spottlighting gay marriages ... and you have issues with that ... because your a butt fucker ... oh well ...deal with it
36863 Angla :  Rebekah: gparted is ok. good old *fdisk is fine too
36866 Rochel :  Horacio, yes, some daemon...
36871 Jesse :  Rochel: no
36872 Rebekah :  ok tks
36873 Becki :  I see no problem with public sex, as long as it's fully consensual.  How would seeing two people pleasing each other and expressing their love hurt you?
36882 Jesse :  Rochel: it should Just Work(tm)
36884 Melda :  Arlie: Glad to see that you can bring such enlightening information to this conversation (rofl
36888 Madison :  Becki: cant be serious
36892 Rochel :  Horacio, and how do i remove the rule later?
36906 Madison :  WTF the is the world coming toooooo
36909 Madison :  public sex
36909 Daryl :  Becki: it doesn't hurt me as such, I just don't want to see it. And they might have seriously ugly bodies. So like, ew.
36915 Melda :  Arlie: you sound like exactly the kind of guy that beats his wife for having sex in a non missionary position and then gets caught out at night with a tranny while trying to be so "godlike" hah
36920 Daryl :  I suppose I could say it's my /right/ to not have to see it.
36923 Shakia *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
36939 Daryl :  If people wish to go to areas such as nude beaches, etc, and be fully naked or having sex around other people who enjoy the same, that's okay with me.
36940 Jesse :  Rochel: iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING n (where n is the 1-based number of the rule in the PREROUTING chain)
36940 Madison :  i dont give a fuck what anyone saus ....... a 4 year old seeing someone give a blow job WILLL affect them
36954 Becki :  but I could say it's their right to express their love in a physical fashion...
36962 Angla :  Melda: interesting imagery ...
36964 Jesse :  Madison: you have some research to back this up?
36966 Daryl :  But why does it have to be in front of anyone else?
36966 Hiram *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
36969 Shira :  But beeing open about sex could lead you to ackward situations: Intervju with a mother "reporter: So your daughter are a fast learner. Mother: Yes, she is verye bright, arent, wanna give mommy a good bye kiss? 5yo daughter: NOOO, you had dads dick in your mouth this morning! "
36976 Melda :  Madison: agreed.. i don't know how this got to public sex, the initial issue was Arlie being afraid if ever running into homosexuals in public and them tainting he and his children
36980 Clark *  entered the room.
36980 Jesse :  Madison: or is it just 'obvious'
36986 Madison :  Horacio: so we just expose 5 and 6 year olds to public sex ????
37001 Sierra *  entered the room.
37010 Madison :  cant be serious
37011 Becki :  you're right, it might affect that 4 year old...  he/she might grow up with an awareness of the world, his/her own sexuality, realistic body images, and all sorts of horrible things we couldn't possibly allow.
37015 Jesse :  Madison: I didn't say that - I questioned your assertion about the effect of seeing such a thing
37024 Daryl :  Well - I'll say one thing for nudity at least. I've met kids who went to nude beaches with their family. And they seemed to be less hung up on their own body than others.
37028 Shira :  Madison: It wont harm em if the sociaty dosent tell that that it should harm them.
37033 Arlie :  Melda, nice spin ... tell some more lies
37033 Harold *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
37052 Madison :  .............yall are reallly freaking wierd
37057 Madison :  glad your not parenting my kids
37065 Angla :  Madison: that's why they invented saturday morning cinema for kids. so that the adults can get a bit of privacy from the kids
37069 Melda :  Arlie: laff, go read your logs sometime when you're not stoned or something and laugh at yourself with the rest of us
37070 Avis *  entered the room.
37073 Jesse :  Madison: because I suspect it's entirely based on your personal prejudices and inability to deal with sexuality at all ;)
37075 Lamar *  entered the room.
37093 Hilario *  presents the channel with a penis-shaped yule log.  Dig in.
37093 Madison :  Horacio: u cat be serious
37097 Denise *  left the room (quit: ).
37102 Madison :  so you would allow your 5 year old to be exposed to sex ?
37110 Shira :  Madison: Does it harm them to see an halfe naked woman/man at the beach?
37112 Ahmad *  entered the room.
37112 Rochel :  Horacio, it hasnt worked...
37119 Selina *  entered the room.
37123 Daryl :  I think we're mixing issues a little overall
37134 Madison :  Horacio: answer ^^
37134 Jesse :  Madison: if your question is, do I think a child will be harmed by seeing others having sex, I would rather doubt it
37139 Arlie :  Melda, first off, the logs are public for everyone to read, second, i never said i was afraid of gay people, i said i didnt think it belonged under the spotlight at disney world ... and you took offense to that, which is fine, be offended, im offended by 2 gay men showing affection and rubbing on each other ... but afraid of it ? dream on
37148 Natividad :  every naturally delivered child has been in intimate contact with their mother's private parts... think on this.
37150 Selina :  is there a linux distro that handles 3d desktops better than other?
37161 Crissy :  Georgia child may ask questions or refer to it at inappropriate times.
37166 Melda :  Arlie: mmk, interpret yourself irrationally if you so desire, but that doesn't change what you've said
37170 Jesse :  Selina: no, it's a question of video card and driver
37171 Angla :  Crissy: no. they are all nonsense
37172 Madison :  are you all athesit toooooo ?
37177 Madison :  st
37190 Becki :  how many of today's major problems are caused by sexual insecurity?  the massive market for enlargment products, suggestive advertising, many rapes (especially statuatory rapes), obsessions with weight loss, body shape, etc, etc, etc...  if all 4 year olds were as lucky as the one we're discussing, maybe the world would be a much better place.
37193 Daryl :  Question you have to ask yourself is if they see it publically, would they not be wanting to try such a thing theirself? We learn through curiousity of the world around us afterall.
37205 Rebekah :  I cannot seem to be able to resize a NTFS partition via qtparted
37206 Madison :  Horacio: i disagree ad you wont change my mind i think it wuld be very bad for a young child to view or see sex
37211 Rebekah :  its disabled
37213 Angla :  Crissy: oops. i meant Selina
37220 Angla :  ^^^
37223 Crissy :  heh
37228 Becki :  Madison:  ok, please explain how it will be very bad.
37230 Jesse :  Madison: you ask if I grovel before some abrahamic sky spirit? to me, that is merely insulting - we are not in the middle ages
37232 Daryl :  Madison: mostly for the reason said above, I would  probably agree.
37246 Madison :  its just not right
37247 Jesse :  Madison: I'm not trying to change your mind, you asked for my opinion
37249 Selina :  lol whats nonsense, 3d desktops or linux :)
37249 Madison :  Sex is made for adults
37254 Madison :  not children
37267 Selina :  uhh slacker.. sex is more for teenagers than adults
37273 Crissy :  What's the appropriate age?
37274 Madison :  thats not children
37289 Angla :  Selina: 3d desktops. beryl the peril. compiz. vista. osx aqua. phooey
37291 Madison :  and sex is for sure an adult thing
37295 Madison :  teens is where it can start
37297 Selina :  i continued the habit into adulthood tho
37300 Becki :  yes.  that's why their bodies don't perform sexual functions yet.  Being fully aware of sex, its responsibilies, sexuality, etc, before their body reaches that stage, will prevent a lot of later problems.
37312 Madison :  wtf
37313 Madison :  oh man
37326 Madison :  why dont we give blow job demonstrations while we are at it
37332 Shira :  Madison: I'd say i child will come to alot more harm by seing it's parents fight and yell to eatch other then to see them having sex
37344 Jesse :  Shira: undubitably
37347 Madison :  i think its same effect
37349 Selina :  i dont even want to know how this convo started :)
37363 Alena *  entered the room.
37368 Angla :  Madison: i'd be up for that. i want two french maids, with all the trimmings tho ;)
37371 Crissy :  undubitably? I have no idea what that is
37377 Crissy :  a contronym?
37377 Daryl :  Well ask if they see sex, do you want them also engaging in it? Would that be considered okay too?
37392 Angla :  indubitably
37393 Becki :  Madison:  so far you have yet to give any reason better than "it just is".  Care to explain how properly educating and exposing children to sexuality will do anything other than help them later in their lives?
37393 Madison :  fdfdfdsfads
37396 Daryl :  If not, why not? Because seeing it will make them curious.
37398 Madison :  im out you people are to much
37408 Jesse :  Crissy: you are not a native english speaker?
37411 Daryl :  So for me, I wouldn't want them seeing it and sparking that idea in their head too young.
37421 Shira :  Madison: I bet you voted for bush and is pro survailence as weel
37427 Crissy :  Horacio: I speak Minnesotan.
37427 Shira :  well
37434 Madison :  Shira: exactly far left liberal
37435 Becki :  Daryl:  the best way to make a child curious is to tell them NOT to do something, and hide it from them.  taking all the mystery away will give them a lot less reason to be curious.
37437 Madison :  cause i ddint
37449 Selina :  what is distro that configures easily like pclinux but is more predictable?
37462 Margit *  entered the room.
37462 Shira :  Madison: dont take the word liberal in your mouth, as you are anything but liberal
37463 Daryl :  If you show them sex and say "it's okay to do it" may equally leave them wanting to do it.
37464 Angla :  i've actuallt been to minnesota. twice. they all speak a funny sort of german
37466 Alisa *  left the room (quit: "leaving").
37469 Crissy :  hehe
37473 Jesse :  Crissy: does that mean you can speak no language? ;)
37480 Lynsey *  left the room (quit: "- nbs-irc 2.21 - www.nbs-irc.net -").
37494 Glynda *  entered the room.
37496 Madison :  Shira: im not liberal your right
37502 Emilia :  in fstab, how do i specify an nfs mount such that the mount is skipped on boot if the nfs share isn't available?
37505 Daryl :  Afterall, it's generally depicted as something both pleasurable and intimate. Why wouldn't they? I'd be curious about doing the same thing that makes anyone feel that good
37508 Calista *  entered the room.
37510 Crissy :  I was just curious of undubitably was an antonym of indubitably.
37530 Calista :  hello
37535 Becki :  children should also be taught about the responsibilies and risks of sex, not just the physical aspects.
37537 Angla :  Madison: do you despise the jew, the queer, and the liberal ?
37539 Odelia *  left the room (quit: ).
37541 Clark :  Calista ol?, hauahuah
37551 Calista :  i have   inspiron 6400
37565 Angla :  dell
37571 Crissy :  or if it was just a typo
37571 Angla :  laptop
37573 Calista :  and i  want put  my  display  widescreen
37575 Shira :  Madison: maybe you should convert to muslim and move to iran, so your should dosent have to see people wearing provocative clothes
37578 Becki :  having non-masturabatory sex carries quite a few risks and responsibilities...  which most definitely shouldn't be hidden from children.
37582 Thurman *  entered the room.
37587 Daryl :  Teenagers are, and we still have a high number of teenage pregnancies. Question is.. why? They move sex education younger and younger and the stat doesn't go down any. True, maybe sex education is just ineffective.
37594 Calista :  im  using  debian
37606 Crissy :  someone's got a broken space bar?
37607 Daryl :  I was taught the beginning of sex ed from my school at 10 before it was even an idea in my head to do it.
37611 Thurman :  hi, is it possible to login via ssh and run a gtk application and send it to the current runniing session of gnome?
37616 Becki :  most sex education is completely and totally worthless...
37630 Angla :  Thurman: absolutely
37631 Becki :  and it's still way too hard to get birth control
37641 Crissy :  Thurman: on the target machine?  export DISPLAY=:0
37648 Calista :  Angla: can u  hellp me?
37671 Daryl :  I'm just not convinced free love is a good thing. I'm not saying I'm against education though, I don't even think minor nudity is particularly harmful, or some education. I just think there's some kind of limitations to be had here and there.
37673 Thurman :  Crissy: will it quit when i exit the ssh session?
37680 Angla :  Calista: are you in gnome ?
37684 Calista :  kde
37688 Shira :  Yhee very hard to get birth controll pills.. just go to the clinic and ask for them, it's free here for teenagers :)
37693 Tu *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
37700 Jenae *  entered the room.
37702 Crissy :  probably depends on whether it responds to HUP
37708 Daryl :  Plus I don't believe I want to see anyone else's sexual experience honestly. It's between those two people, not the rest of us
37717 Lynsey *  entered the room.
37717 Shira :  well im hitting the bed now, nighty
37724 Genevive *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
37725 Becki :  Shira:  cyas
37729 Angla :  Calista: try editing your xorg.conf to the native resolution of the lcd
37741 Thurman :  Crissy: if i run it as & ? will it still wuit?
37752 Crissy :  though I'm not sure when apps do and don't get sent hups when you detach
37754 Becki :  Daryl:  perhaps, but it doesn't hurt you to do so, either...
37756 Crissy :  Thurman: try it and find out
37757 Tu *  entered the room.
37758 Crissy :  I don't know :P
37760 Calista :  i put my xorg.conf   in 1280x800
37766 Sammie *  entered the room.
37779 Becki :  people argue, play chess, and do all sorts of random things in public.
37785 Rochel :  Horacio, i got this: Unknown Protocol for this port

37829 Sammie *  left the room.
37833 Jesse :  Rochel: that's fine, it's not a 'well known' port
37845 Angla :  Crissy/Thurman "&" and nohup, bg, screen etc all have limitations. but you can generally get something going
37846 Daryl :  I'd rather not have to watch anyone else's arguing, stabbing each other, or any other action they want to carry out. It's just me, it makes me uncomfortable personally. I'm not hung up on my sexuality, or sex. I just don't enjoy having to see it. Or arguing, etc.
37856 Jesse :  Rochel: you got 'stealth', 'close', or 'open' ?
37860 Rochel :  Horacio, but my bt client do not work
37870 Rochel :  steath
37879 Crissy :  my solution is to run anything I want to keep running in a vnc session
37884 Jesse :  Rochel: arrgghh
37886 Rochel :  Horacio, and azureus is running
37889 Daryl :  I guess it's just complicated on where you draw the line on what should and shouldn't be seen in publically
37894 Daryl :  public* :)

37930 Jesse :  Rochel: pastebin the output of 'iptables -t nat -L'
37936 Jesse :  if you like ;)
37943 Becki :  heh.  personally I think our young people would grow up happier and healthier if they were exposed to sex as a normal thing...  think about how many billions of dollars would be saved on shrinks, for example.  :)
37947 Daryl :  and I wouldn't proclaim to have all the answers. I don't.
37947 Nakesha *  entered the room.
38001 Angla :  Crissy: yeah
38007 Daryl :  Becki: I can't argue and say "no they wouldn't" anyway, and I wouldn't argue that. YOu might be right, I honestly don't know :)
38013 Crissy :  I IRC, IM, and keep xterms open there.
38024 Crissy :  and a browser
38028 Lashandra *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
38030 Becki :  and sex toys should be available for people of all ages.  A teen who can satisfy herself is less likely to let a guy sleep with her...  same for a guy, if his hormones were more taken care of, would be less obsessed with finding someone to sleep with.
38031 Alena *  is now known as Alena
38034 Crissy :  but I do most of my browsing on the local machine

38074 Hertha *  entered the room.
38078 Becki :  Daryl:  heh, I've had to think about these things quite a bit at one of my previous jobs...

38261 Jesse :  Rochel: oh, no - sorry, I'm too tired to get into this now
38280 Rochel :  ohh, ok
38294 Tennie *  entered the room.
38301 Rochel :  Horacio, just, please, help with another thing, if u can...
38318 Fernando :  Angla: I mean, I would use gentoo, if I had the time to config all 234 files in /etc every time I compile something new (joke)
38323 Jesse :  Angla: *snort*

38476 Rochel :  Horacio, its a order number?
38490 Odelia *  entered the room.
38498 Angla :  Fernando: which net install ?
38516 Fernando :  I don't remember, let me find the disk, I might had written it on it

38540 Rochel :  Horacio, tnx
38547 Rochel :  Horacio, good night
38551 Angla :  Fernando: i keep the same xorg.conf for all the distros. well sort of. some use xfs, some don't
38553 Fernando :  nope, not sure which
38559 Jesse :  Rochel: you're welcome
38572 Angla :  Fernando: debian or ubuntu or what ?
38574 Fernando :  Angla: the thing is, xorg 7.0 was unstable
38581 Fernando :  in debian
38586 Angla :  right

38604 Arlinda *  left the room ("Coming Back").

38644 Fernando :  so I tried setting it up, and could not get it to work correctly on debain
38648 Jenae :  What is the most featureful CLI web browser?
38657 Fernando :  even with the same Xorg.conf from other distros I have used
38665 Angla :  i did debian testing/unstable for a while. when you get right down to it, all distros are deficient in some way or another
38667 Myrtis :  Jenae try links2 and w3m
38690 Fernando :  Angla: I agree
38695 Myrtis :  waht's debian deficient in, update speed?
38700 Jenae :  Myrtis: What about Elinks?
38708 Fernando :  Myrtis: yeah
38710 Myrtis :  Jenae haven't tried it
38716 Cathrine :  anyone know of a safe way to remove the paint/dye on the keys of a keyboard?
38720 Rosette :  vitamin u
38738 Angla :  Fernando: i was saying earlier i'd like the fedora kernel, and the debian apt thing. debhat or fedorian
38752 Myrtis :  heh
38755 Myrtis :  make your own kernel
38757 Fernando :  Angla: lol, that'll be nice
38781 Fernando :  yeah Ill be using my own custom kernel for now on not matter what distro
38788 Myrtis :  I find the fedora kernel/init system annoying to work with
38808 Myrtis :  I don't use a custom kernel on some computer, it's more maintenance
38816 Angla :  yeah
38849 Fernando :  Myrtis: I find all init systems annorying to work with, personally I think that using so many files like that is a mistake
38877 Angla :  i have 5 machines that need to be more or less in synch, so it's fedora based. but i do all sorts of mixter-maxter stuff on my own personal baby
38886 Fernando :  I think they should keep init.d for the scripts, but then use one file for rc.x
38924 Fernando :  instread of some symbloic link hell like it is now
38934 Della *  entered the room.
38945 Rosette :  like slackware

39055 Lourdes :  Hey, is there a way I can avoid another user to see the stuff in my home folder in a -safe- way? I'm scared to use chmod 'cause I think that could screw things up afterwards :/
39059 Fernando :  yeah, but I think ubuntu is a good, stable, apt/deb based distro.  that has a lot of support and stuff
39065 Rosette :  lol well I havent used 2.4.x on slackware in a few years so your preaching to the choir on that
39078 Bethann *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).

39115 Rosette :  thats why i hate it, because....it...works..for me?? wait a second

39142 Darrick *  entered the room.
39151 Jesse :  Fernando: feisty seems a bit flakey, from what a friend tells me

39287 Rosette :  oh gawd i hate that "game"
39288 Fernando :  Horacio: I say debian is aimed at just that
39288 Angla :  Fernando: the only thing wrong with ubuntu 7.04 is the kernel. of course, the purists will hammer me for saying that
39308 Lourdes :  WoW runs awesome in Linux though =p
39318 Rosette :  yes it does
39328 Angla :  "if the kernel don't work, what the 'eck have you got, squire"
39339 Fernando :  Lourdes: thats because WoW spent the $50 needed to get it to work in wine lol
39365 Lourdes :  Fernando: and they were well worth it :P
39370 Verona *  dances xD
39373 Fernando :  Lourdes: don't see why the other 50,000 compains that make $50,000,000,000 a year can't do it

39457 Angla :  Horacio: are you a soft southerner, with a "gawd blimey" accent ? i've often wondered
39468 Fernando :  Horacio: all they have to do is fix some system calls, and a few GL things to get it to work in WINE (most of the time)
39484 Jesse :  Angla: I'm from .ie ;)
39489 Lourdes :  Duh, I wonder why people is so fast in detecting program errors, but don't bother to help :(
39509 Jesse :  Fernando: why are you raving to me about some wine thing?
39515 Krystina *  entered the room.
39515 Fernando :  Horacio: in all time, any windows programs can been twicked to work perfectly in wine in about 1-3 weeks.  shorter if there is mac openGL code to steal
39516 Lourdes :  lol
39521 Angla :  Horacio: yeah. i think the stock feisty kernel is a bit shoddy. but hopefully they'll do something soon
39589 Angla :  Horacio: i was watching rory gallagher irish tour '74 dvd yesterday. mmmmm

39873 Jessie :  Hello. I have a file with hundreds of lines of comments that I'd like to delete the commented lines from. I can identify the lines by testing for ^# but I what I really need is something like this: grep not(^#) theFile > newFile. How would I do that?
39898 Jessie :  I realize grep not(^#) is not valid syntax but that's the gist of what I'm looking for.
39905 Angla :  no promises, but i might make a donation at the end of this month and get a shield

40194 Angla :  Jessie: i messed about with awk to get something like that going. you have to "parse" the file, essentially
40216 Jessie :  It's a Dovecot config file. There are so many comment lines that it is hard to see what options are actually being set.
40231 Delmar *  entered the room.
40232 Jessie :  Hmmm. I can probably do this in Python easily enough.
40243 Tasha :  seems like "sed d/\s*#/" would work for that

40260 Trisha *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
40279 Angla :  Jessie: very similar to what i wanted. i had multi-platform C source with loads of #if #ifdef #ifndef etc, and wanted to read it

40551 Angla :  may 12th 1983
40558 Angla :  lol
40559 Margery :  or when unix first started having the concept of users with differnt privialages
40563 Margery :  Angla: are you serious?
40573 Williams *  entered the room.
40578 Angla :  no
40593 Margery :  take a look at this: http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7010755.PN.&OS=PN/7010755

40635 Tasha :  Margery: unix was originally designed as a multi-user system, before there was any concept of personal computers.  Everyone just used terminals on a mainframe.
40639 Margery :  Microsoft filed a patent in 2002 for technology that was invented in 1985

40722 Gail *  entered the room.
40744 Sharlene *  entered the room.
40757 Angla :  Margery: dos claims "prior art" from unix. if you know what i mean ...
40790 Sharlene :  If you were given this post office address: "1601 Route 112", would you interpret that as Route 112, Box 1601?
40808 Arlie :  i think thanks to linux, and other F/OSS ... microsofts legal protection is gonna disappear, because their fraud will be apparent to everyone including grandma at some point
40818 Arlie :  Sharlene, no
40820 Angla :  Sharlene: ask Arlie, he's a colonial
40827 Arlie :  Sharlene, route normally means "rural route"
40846 Arlie :  Sharlene, route can also mean, a road
40854 Marylin *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
40863 Arlie :  Sharlene, like .... Route 66 ... its a highway, but not an interstate
40872 Angla :  Arlie: they offer "unlimited intellectual property indemnity" as long as you sign the paper. what a crock
40887 Sharlene :  Arlie: what could be interpreted by the 1601?
40888 Samuel *  entered the room.
40892 Arlie :  Sharlene, the post office has explanations of these things on their website ;)
40899 Arlie :  Sharlene, the house/building number
40915 Sharlene :  aha! :)
40928 Sharlene :  thank you :]
40932 Arlie :  np
40943 Arlie :  if you really want to know, go read the post office addressing standards
40946 Angla :  don't they do it by 100s for buildings, so as to allow plenty of homeless mexicans an address ?
40957 Arlie :  Angla, not exactly ;)
40983 Jessie :  Sharlene: in Canada, 1419-3266 Yonge St. means 3266 Yonge St., Suite 1419. That's usually the case in the U.S. too.
40984 Genevive *  entered the room.
41002 Jessie :  That address you posted, the first number is the street address.
41025 Margery :  Angla: I'm from Chicago, and I can tell you its done for counting purposes: Western (2400 W) is 24 blocks from State (0E/W)
41040 Margery :  IIRC
41048 Becki :  bbl, wolfy bedtime
41049 Arlie :  in the US, that would be "3266 Yonge ST, # 1419" or ", Suite 1419" or ",Unit 1419"
41070 Jessie :  I'll bet 1419-3266 will work too.
41073 Talia *  entered the room.
41089 Arlie :  but the zip+4 code and the name of the recipient is more important than anything
41090 Becki :  I've always seen the address before the suite number.'
41094 Becki :  bbl
41096 Jessie :  Otherwise, nothing addressed that way would ever readh its destination in the U.S.
41106 Angla :  Margery: oh ok. yeah i do canada a bit. i live in queen charlotte street. none of this "53rd and 12th" grid thing for me
41108 Kraig *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
41110 Arlie :  Jessie, no, the zip+4 code is what gets it there
41114 Talia :  Why does sudo allow me to not type a password to run a command as root?
41119 Francisco :  with bash, how do i check if a variable exists or not?
41120 Marvel *  is now known as Marvel
41126 Jessie :  zip+4 isn't specific enough to find the building, is it?
41133 Talia :  root@mcp-hexaflake:~# sudo ls /
41133 Talia :  bin   dev  home  lost+found  mnt  proc  sbin     srv       sys  usr
41133 Talia :  boot  etc  lib   media       opt  root  sources  swapfile  tmp  var
41140 Talia :  ...
41149 Talia :  Why did that have to get split up?
41152 Bruno *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
41158 Forrest *  entered the room.
41167 Angla :  i'm confused
41169 Tasha :  Jessie: zip+4 is supposed to be able to identify the specific building.
41171 Arlie :  Jessie, yes, because zip+4 puts it in the carriers hand, who knows his route well enough to find the building based on the recipients name
41189 Velva *  left the room ("Leaving").
41194 Sharlene :  Francisco: if you need more added advice, #bash .   I'm not sure about your question..I usually just check if the variable is empty.
41223 Francisco :  Sharlene: i think checking if the variable is empty would work also, how do you do that?
41230 Francisco :  its all i need to write a 2 line script
41240 Talia :  travis@mcp-hexaflake:~$ sudo ls /
41242 Talia :  That works
41246 Jessie :  So zip+4 cannot uniquely identify a building. It requires human interpretation, assuming we can consider letter carriers human :)
41253 Talia :  No password prompt, and it's been more than 5 min.
41262 Angla :  lol
41265 Sharlene :  Francisco:    if [ -z "$myvar" ] ; then echo "Georgia variable is empty" ; fi
41270 Arlie :  Jessie, technically, yes, zip+4 puts it within a range of addresses within 1 single route
41272 Misti *  entered the room.
41283 Talia :  Yup, after sudo -K, same thing
41284 Misti :  alguem me anjudapor favor
41293 Angla :  Mindy: you are already logged in as root. isn't that what the # prompt means ?
41296 Sharlene :  Francisco:   if [ "$myvar" = ''] ; then echo "Georgia variable is empty" ; fi
41299 Francisco :  Sharlene: great thanks!
41299 Tasha :  Jessie: it would work if we put our zip+4 on our mailboxes, but no one does that.  zip+4 was devised for emergency services, I believe.
41302 Talia :  yeah
41305 Talia :  I typed exit
41307 Arlie :  Jessie, a large building might have its own zip+4 code ... whereas a block of houses on 1 street might all share a zip+4 code
41313 Laverne *  entered the room.
41315 Vito *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
41324 Tonja *  entered the room.
41324 Arlie :  no
41329 Talia :  Now I'm back at my prompt, I type sudo -K and then sudo ls / and it works
41334 Sharlene :  Francisco:   [ -z "$myvar" ] && { echo "Variable is empty" ; echo "Peace out" }
41337 Bobette *  is now known as Bobette
41340 Sharlene :  Francisco: ;)
41342 Becki :  we don't seem to use the zip+4 out here in the boonies...  hell, you don't even need to put down an address, mailing things by name works too.
41344 Talia :  I'm a normal user now, not root
41346 Arlie :  zip+4 puts the letter or package to the unique carrier route
41352 Veola :  why odd numbers are being skipped in linux kernel subversion 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 are just the ones i have witnessed
41353 Misti *  left the room ("[CyberScript]").
41353 Francisco :  Sharlene: trying to be slick nor or something? ;) :)
41356 Angla :  shells within shells. an enigma wrapped in a mystery, shrouded in darkness
41361 Francisco :  nor/now/s
41369 Becki :  Veola:  odd numbers are development versions.
41383 Josephina *  left the room (quit: "Saying you're a patriot is like saying you've got a big cock: if you have to say it, it's probably not true").
41385 Arlie :  there are also carrier route numbers, but a single carrier can have more than 1 zip+4 code in his route
41387 Veola :  thanks Becki
41399 Sharlene :  Francisco: I've got to teach you how to impress your friends with slick bash skillz lol
41399 Talia :  Um...what do I do to the /etc/sudoers file to make sudo ask me for a password?
41408 Arlie :  and all this info is on the postal service website ;)
41414 Francisco :  Sharlene: heh, thanks
41417 Jessie :  Canada's postal codes haven't been around as long as U.S. ZIP codes so when it was implemented, I believe in the '70s when I was a kid, they decided on XNX NXN as the format. That is specific enough to get it to a few houses in a dense area but not in rural areas.
41421 Becki :  heh, there's only one route around here, and it only covers a few closer-to-the-post-office houses...  virtually everyone else, including myself, only gets a po box.
41430 Tasha :  We should just move from regular zip codes to zipv6
41432 Becki :  not even rural delivery here.
41439 Becki :  have to drive a town over
41444 Angla :  Tasha: very good
41455 Jessie :  Tasha: why not just IPv6? :)
41473 Tasha :  Jessie: I doubt the post office wants to deal with the routing tables
41479 Talia :  # Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
41479 Talia :  %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
41483 Jessie :  IPv6 has to be useful for something.
41493 Talia :  I need to be asked for a password
41501 Samuel :  what is better to use.. unionfs or aufs?
41502 Shonda *  hello 
41514 Becki :  ipv6 is very useful...  it keeps the people who want to put microprocessors in our toasters busy, so they don't screw with things that work.  :)
41532 Sharlene :  Tasha: zipv6 lol
41548 Angla :  Talia: there must be something alse in there. like : yourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL or something
41555 Francisco :  Sharlene: is there a way to check if an instance of some program is already running instead?
41577 Genevive *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
41582 Francisco :  Sharlene: i guess checking the variable isn't good enough :-\
41586 Becki :  bbl, tired wolfy.
41602 Erick *  entered the room.
41642 Sharlene :  Francisco: I've never had to fully concentrated on that problem and created something stable...what you could do is something like:
41643 Sharlene :  ps aux | grep -c 'nameOfProcess'
41645 Sharlene :  To get the # of processes running under the name 'nameOfProcess'
41652 Lavonne *  entered the room.
41673 Avery *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

41731 Sharlene :  [ $processes -gt 1 ] && { echo "Oh crap there are too many processes running, over and out" ; exit 1 }
41737 Angla :  Sharlene: not quite. the ps matches too
41753 Sharlene :  Angla: good call!
41762 Francisco :  Angla: thats why he has -gt 1 right?
41801 Sharlene :  Francisco: well...sometimes the actual 'grep' shows up, PLUS the original process, PLUS the one that's checking to see if the original is running.
41810 Angla :  i do things like : ps | grep [m]yprogname
41827 Angla :  because of the shell expansion
41829 Sharlene :  Angla: excellent
41830 Francisco :  Angla: what's with the []?
41862 Sharlene :  Francisco: it's regular expressions in BASH.  Like when you go:     vim *.cpp
41882 Priscila :  It's not.
41884 Priscila :  It's a glob.
41887 Sharlene :  You could also go:    vim [abc].cpp    to get the files:   a.cpp b.cpp c.cpp
41891 Ollie *  entered the room.
41905 Angla :  Priscila: pedant ! :)
41908 Francisco :  well basically i was reading a tutorial that says to put ... eval `ssh-agent` in your bash startup script however the problem with that is that each time i open a terminal it starts a new instance, i just want 1 and want the variables it outputs available on all instances?
41912 Sharlene :  glob, regular expression, I always get those mixed
41913 Priscila :  Angla: Not in this case!
41932 Priscila :  Francisco: Check the URL given to you in #bash
41960 Honey *  entered the room.
41975 Sharlene :  Francisco:  do not put it into .bashrc   put it into  .bash_profile
41989 Sharlene :  Georgia .bash_profile gets executed only when you login
42003 Ollie :  why does my xorg say its version 1.3.0?  im runing /unstable and achording to aptitude am apt-get'ing version 1:7.2-3.  yet -version shows 1.3.0.0?
42005 Talia *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
42015 Sharlene :  .bashrc   gets executed everytime you open an xterm, or an aterm, or any terminals.
42031 Francisco :  Sharlene: oh ok, let me try it
42032 Honey :  i'm creating my linux partitions, should it be something like 80% ext3 and 20% swap?
42034 Angla :  Sharlene: it's time i got pedantic too. .bashrc is only for interactive shells ?
42046 Honey :  what percentage should swap be?
42067 Lakisha *  entered the room.
42072 Sharlene :  Angla: lol I believe you're right.
42079 Sharlene :  not just any shell!
42086 Jessie :  Honey: depends on how much RAM you have. If you have lots of RAM, you don't need as much swap.
42087 Angla :  Honey: something like : 2X your ram for swap
42122 Sharlene :  Honey: how much RAM do you have?
42126 Jessie :  Honey: ideally, you don't want to have to hit swap. Disk space is cheap so you can allocate anywhere from 1x to 2x of RAM to swap.

42427 Romona :  when must swap be bigger or be twice the ran? just for suspend to disk?
42431 Honey :  the swap is a type: logical, right?
42434 Romona :  *ram
42452 Myrtis :  Romona it doesn't always have to be even twice ram
42470 Honey :  wouldn't the swap help in displaying 3d graphics?

42554 Myrtis :  swap is best unused, and ram is best completely used
42567 Aleshia *  entered the room.
42595 Jesse :  swap should be used - unused crap should be paged out to make space for file cache
42616 Sharlene :  Horacio: but should only be used if RAM doesn't cover everything.
42647 Myrtis :  hm I suppose. doesn't linux use a limited amount of ram for file cache though?

43692 Talia :  Does irssi have a sub-shell command?
43715 Angla :  Blondell: but you have to pay. clamav has never failed, or given a false positive yet
43718 Felicia :  Arlie: well .. i recall you pushing this concept of "anyone can be an einstein, and just do it ..  it's the status quo that's keeping us all down" .. it's just a case-in-point i'm showing ;-)

43929 Talia :  There, now I am working on a VGA console so, I don't think 5 lines is too much to ask for
43945 Blondell :  thanks. much appreciate
43946 Talia :  That was from /etc/sudoers
43953 Kimberely *  entered the room.
43957 Francisco :  Sharlene: so ~/.bash_profile is the only that is only supposed to get executed once huh?

44043 Francie :  Felicia, nor did I care
44048 Myrtis :  Talia if you think about it, there's a good reason the password is asked for, though
44049 Sharlene :  Talia: my example didn't help? :'(
44055 Talia :  Myrtis: what is this option?
44061 Myrtis :  NOPASSWD:

44097 Myrtis :  again, this is stupid
44099 Myrtis :  don't do it :)
44100 Blondell :  Francie : google it. its like vnc+rdp on steroids into your linux box
44111 Talia :  Err...never set anything with NOPASSWD in it
44122 Angla :  Sharlene: i didn't like to say, but i think you may have got the logic inverted. he was asking (if i read correctly) why he *didn't* have to enter a root password :)

44137 Sharlene :  Myrtis: if you're on a PC, in a house, and you're the only user using the PC...then it's not stupid.
44150 Talia :  Angla: yes, that's right
44151 Blondell :  check it out and judge for yourself
44156 Felicia :  (well , that's not entirely true .. they're more brainwashed than anything else)
44157 Francie :  okay
44158 Blondell :  its like your are in a true X session
44165 Francie :  :D
44166 Myrtis :  Sharlene you could have sudo remember that you entered the password for longer

44190 Sharlene :  Angla: aahh I rushed too fast
44196 Maudie *  entered the room.

44360 Jesse :  Felicia: w3m is great! it removes all those ugly tags once and for all!
44376 Francie :  Percy, if you are getting error 503, that probably means you are trying to access some website which you are not allowed to access

44410 Jesse :  Felicia: 'v' in w3m
44418 Francie :  Percy, if you are getting access denied and it is a windows *server*, unless the net admin is smart, you can probably just nslookup the website and put in the IP instead
44433 Jesse :  Felicia: and I agree, a vital implement

46760 Mauro :  Levi: i use motherboards that have on-board graphics cards because (1) i don't need anything fancy for video, and (2) i don't have to deal with video card headaches
46771 Laverne :  how to check which version of glibc I have installed?
46772 Sharlene :  I think ballmer would throw a chair on the other side of the room than have that happen

46844 Levi :  thats ultimate lag
46845 Carol *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
46856 Percy :  Elia: yes, but from switch <> switch on a normal port
46858 Rosa :  will allocating more swap than required degrade the performance of my system? like i have 1 gb ram and 4 gb swap...
46860 Mauro :  Elia: what else could you do with it?  ;)
46864 Tamiko *  entered the room.
46866 Percy :  the uplink ports are already crossed inside
46866 Margit *  left the room (quit: "This computer has gone to sleep").
46869 Elia :  Percy: Come again?
46874 Sharlene :  Elia: yep.  And set your NIC with a static IP address and the appropriate subnet.  (e.g. 255.255.255.0)
46882 Mauro :  Rosa: swap's only used when it's needed
46882 Rosa :  or is it just that the extra swap will be idle?
46882 Angla :  Laverne: not sure if that's what you actually want. the version of gcc and the version of glibc have been known to differ ...
46892 Percy :  Elia: if you want to connect two switches together, you'll need what's known as a crossover cable, as opposed to the normal staright-through cable
46902 Mauro :  Rosa: so no, having way too much swap space won't affect performance
46906 Elia :  Mauro: Idaknow, but it's plugged into my laptop's cat5 jack and the other machine's cat5 jack and I'm not getting a response on ping.
46916 Emilia *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
46917 Percy :  Elia: but modern switches got rid of that issue by assigning one port as an 'uplink port', which does teh crossing for you
46924 Mauro :  Elia: is each machine on the same subnet?
46927 Evalyn *  entered the room.
46934 Elia :  Hm, I guess I should activate eth0.
46938 Mauro :  Elia: hahah yeah
46942 Elia :  I'm on a wireless network;  do I have to disable eth1?
46945 Laverne :  Angla: sorry to create confusion, i want to know about the version of my glibc(which is installed), I am using Ubuntu 7.04
46952 Rosa :  Mauro: so u mean to say having more than required swap is just same as wasting hdd space?

49259 Ana :  she was married at the time and told her husband she was visiting a friend for a week and stayed 6 weeks, then when she got back she gave him the boot and i moved in,
49259 Azzie :  or something like that
49277 Doug :  I installed it before and my sudo didnt work after that so im not doing it agen
49282 Albertina *  entered the room.
49284 Ana :  your lucky Angla canadian women are pretty nice
49284 Azzie :  PAM is good
49288 Angla :  Levi: there are always problems with kernels and drivers. i've told you what i know from my experience. if you want a written contract and indemnity for intellectual property suits, try windows
49288 Doug :  i have to install it for some remote desktop server thing
49293 Doug :  whats the differnece?
49298 Abbie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
49309 Albertina :  hey has anyone here had any success installing a digium tdm400p card?
49310 Lane :  can someone guide me regarding this matter
49319 Levi :  windows is the best and worst

49365 Myrl :  but i cant even create a new file using vi
49365 Maple *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
49366 Levi :  had a much better chance
49369 Myrl :  strange :(
49378 Doug :  so greg how do i go about instaling PAM properly?
49382 Doug :  without ruining sudo
49383 Ana :  Lane:  use gaim or pidgen
49383 Lane :  u mean it cannot connect to irc
49389 Doug :  the prog ses i just need the pam headers
49395 Malik :  it's called pidgin

49431 Albertina :  anyone installed asterisk here?
49434 Odelia *  entered the room.
49446 Francie :  Albertina, asterisk is old, use trixbox
49447 Myrtis :  Doug you might consider upgrading to a newer version of your distro that uses pam, although it IS possible to mix pam and non-pam
49448 Lane *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
49458 Francie :  Albertina, they renamed asterisk to trixbox, and reset the version nubmers
49463 Albertina :  yeah only thing is I want to keep my OS
49472 Myrtis :  I remember having to install pam libraries and stuff once to get vmware to work
49480 Albertina :  Francie, I don't want to blow away my OS that is
49492 Angla :  Albertina: we're not ignoring you, and i shouldn't really speak for others here (but i will) no-one's even heard of the digium tdm400p here
49517 Shanelle *  entered the room.

49547 Albertina :  godzirra, thanks... asterisk was built by the guys who own digium who provide linux compatible phone cards
49550 Elvin :  Say, where does one get rot13 from? Is that included with something else?
49561 Albertina :  oops Angla I mean :)
49568 Renetta *  entered the room.
49581 Azzie :  hahaha
49609 Abbie *  entered the room.
49612 Myrtis :  Elvin you might consider it a trivial excercise and write your own rot12 program :). i'm looking though, because it IS included somewhere
49614 Albertina :  Angla, Ife  card is not seen with lspci is it the kernel that doesn't recognize the card or the motherboard which isn't compatible...?
49619 Myrtis :  rot13*
49623 Jesse :  Francie: ?
49646 Myrtis :  Albertina lspci will show any detected cards even if there isn't a driver. you have some other problem
49647 Angla :  Albertina: is it a pci phone ?
49676 Laronda *  entered the room.
49694 Myrl :  in ls -alich is the first colum Owner or Group ??
49704 Meta *  entered the room.
49712 Albertina :  Angla, I guess you could could call it a modem.. except you can plug phones into it... not entirely sure... in this case it has 4 ports
49722 Angla :  Myrl: owner then group
49729 Albertina :  thanks Myrtis (bugger)
49734 Myrl :  thanks
49735 Myrtis :  Myrl neither, but owner comes first
49748 Francie :  Horacio, it's Horacio :D
49748 Elvin :  Myrtis: Yeah, I might do that too :)
49753 Arlie :  why would you use rot anything ?
49762 Arlie :  all its gonna do is slow down your code
49764 Matt *  curses his lack of ability to cut his fingernails with his left hand
49767 Myrtis :  to encrypt important data, Arlie
49769 Myrl :  doesnt 775 means even people belonging to the same group can modify/write files in that directory ??
49769 Myrtis :  duh
49777 Arlie :  oh .. right .. silly me ;)
49779 Angla :  does rot13 wrap around when you get to ascii 127 ?
49808 Jesse :  Francie: um, ok
49812 Myrtis :  i'm not sure if the default rot13 is case preserving or not
49820 Myrtis :  but it obiously must wrap
49821 Renetta *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
49825 Malik :  Myrl: there's one more moment i think. people from the group should be able to get into that directory first (in terms of permissions)
49828 Albertina :  hey Myrtis if it's not showing up at all... any ideas of what sort of problems would make that happen?
49844 Angla :  Myrl: yes 775 is read/write/execute for all group members
49863 Myrtis :  Albertina i'd suspect a physical problem first, usually what it ends up bieng
49876 Myrl :  Malik ,Angla: i can enter that directory but cant create/modify files inside it
49894 Arlie :  Myrtis, and here i am making access control lists, and encryption settings, and key files for nothing ... when i could just add a number to every byte
49905 Elvia *  entered the room.
49911 Angla :  Myrl: are you in the right group ?
49912 Myrtis :  it's a faster algorithm too, Arlie
49915 Malik :  Myrl: are you sure you added the user to the group correctly?
49925 Myrl :  yes i checked $groups uname
49931 Arlie :  im such a retard ;)
49958 Arlie :  perhaps i'll use it on unix socket and shared memory links ;)
49962 Tora *  left the room (quit: "I didn't set up UberScript properly!").
49967 Albertina :  thanks Myrtis I think you're right... I've tried 2 machines now...
49968 Angla :  Myrl: what is your umask ?
49977 Myrl :  i even did cat /etc/group | grep uname and i can see myself in the group
49978 Shantae *  is around for the first time in some time
49984 Myrtis :  Arlie if you do it twice it's even faster
49998 Angla :  Myrl: log out then in again
50001 Francie :  hm, debian doesn't even come installed with glx gears
50002 Arlie :  and twice as encrypted too ... wow
50005 Kimberely *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
50006 Myrtis :  yep
50015 Myrl :  Angla: my umask is 0002

50067 Lona :  okay... question: say I have linux in pure text mode... what do I want to do if I want an 800x600 framebuffer console?
50080 Francie :  Myrtis, apt-get install glxgears didn't do aynything (couldn't find package)
50081 Lona :  This is actually for an SSH link on a 233MHz PC, if that helps.
50083 Johnie *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
50085 Lona :  :P
50092 Myrtis :  Francie apt-get install mesa-utils
50097 Lona :  0.o
50098 Francie :  k :P
50099 Victorina *  entered the room.
50115 Francie :  Myrtis, but mesa is software based 3D stuff
50119 Ana :  http://www.davesplanet.net/store/
50120 Johnie *  entered the room.
50125 Lona :  hey Ana :D
50128 Myrtis :  Lona framebuffer is a local thing
50128 Francie :  Myrtis, I want the one that uses nvidia graphics card
50136 Myrtis :  Francie do it anyway.
50140 Francie :  k
50156 Lona :  Myrtis: I know, but I mentioned that just in case there was a graphical ssh client out there.
50163 Myrl :   E212: Can't open file for writing :(
50164 Lona :  Myrtis: so... do you have any ideas? ;p
50170 Francie :  Lona, putty
50179 Myrtis :  Lona ssh -X or vnc
50180 Lona :  Francie: does that run in textmode?
50183 Ana :  hey Lona bud what ya doing in here?
50184 Lona :  um
50188 Francie :  Lona, oh, ssh -X yeah
50192 Lona :  Ana: getting debian soon \o/
50205 Ana :  giving up on puppy?
50207 Angla :  let us give thanks
50210 Francie :  Lona, you might consider trying nomachine
50214 Myrtis :  hmm glxgears is going oddly slowly
50215 Lona :  nomachine?>
50219 Latrina *  entered the room.
50228 Francie :  Lona, can't read from an exsisting x session but is pretty cool
50233 Hiram *  entered the room.
50245 Lona :  Francie: what does it do?>
50254 Lona :  Ana: btw, as you're seeing, I have an old 233MHz box I want to set up to SSH into another PC :P
50255 Gricelda *  entered the room.
50264 Myrtis :  ah, for some reason this driver or user can't use direct rendering
50267 Myrtis :  I remember it working
50269 Francie :  Lona, well, it's much faster than VNC... using it, it's like you're in an exsisting x session
50271 Myrtis :  oh well, never use it anyway
50279 Ana :  well dave i guess you could do worse then debian :)
50283 Lona :  lol
50297 Francie :  Lona, very useful if you want to use linux on your laptop but want to be able to switch to windows real quick
50299 Lona :  Ana: what would you recommend if I was looking for something full-featured? :P
50301 Myrtis :  Lona ssh -X lets you use a local X server to manage programs, vnc and similar use a remote X server
50306 Lona :  I know.
50312 Ana :  what i don't know, maybe commodore 64 language
50317 Lona :  LOL
50328 Francie :  Ana, you mean BASIC? :P
50331 Myrtis :  debian isn't full featured now?
50333 Ana :  yes
50334 Clifford *  entered the room.
50338 Lona :  Myrtis: lol
50340 Angla :  6510 assembler
50375 Shakia *  entered the room.
50403 Lona :  Francie: This box's only current future is to ssh into another 450MHz PC that from there serves a web interface... basically, I can use my browser to add events and etc to my to do list, and the more important they are, the more a shade of red they are. Georgia deadlines/things that were supposed to be done yesterday flash bold red :D
50425 Ana :  i miss c-64 basic, man i spent hundred of hours typing pages from compute magazine, just for a simple hi-res graphic game and saving it to audio tape, since floppies weren't invented yet,lol those were the days
50434 Myrtis :  is 3000 fps for glxgears good?
50435 Lona :  lolol
50438 Lona :  Myrtis: wow
50447 Ahmad *  entered the room.
50456 Arlie :  Myrtis, depends on your window size ;)
50462 Myrtis :  hehe
50465 Myrtis :  default window size
50467 Malik :  Ana: you spent hundred of hours for that and how you're trying to cheat on a test?
50467 Angla :  Myrtis: it all depends how big that window is ....
50470 Malik :  liar
50471 Shantae *  makes a mental note to get 32768 FPS for fullscreen glxgears @ 16384x16384 working one day
50484 Lona :  XD
50487 Angla :  Arlie: great minds, and all that ...
50498 Arlie :  Myrtis, thats all i get ... about 3000
50498 Myrtis :  if I make the window small I get 14000 fps
50502 Lona :  nice.
50506 Ana :  Malik:  i was a 10yr old with a c-64 , shit i hardly had a life
50513 Lona :  lolololol
50524 Arlie :  but i didnt buy the nicest nvidia card ... i bought the cheapest dual monitor one
50531 Lona :  pfft
50539 Lona :  sounds like my predicament.
50547 Arlie :  if i stretch glxgears across 2 desktops it gets pretty slow ;)
50555 Lona :  $600: 1000MP stills camera or medium quality handycam?
50557 Francie :  Ana, here I am, a 16 year old, with a 2.6ghz comp, wishing I had a c-64 XD
50560 Lona :  Arlie: lolol
50568 Angla :  i'm getting 28000 fps with a 1-pixel square window
50569 Arlie :  450 fps
50569 Lona :  Francie: roflmao
50575 Arlie :  top half of 2 monitors

50619 Lona :  Cathi: LFS?
50621 Cathi :  i am trying to compile the 2.6.21
50622 Francie :  lmfao
50623 Angla :  Cathi: one or two. shoot
50628 Myrtis :  Cathi yes, why
50648 Johnie *  left the room (quit: Operation timed out).
50649 Francie :  one thing: nomachine does not work very well with 3D stuff lol
50655 Cathi :  well, it says for 2.6.16 to use this patch called http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/ck/patches/2.6/2.6.16/2.6.16-ck12/patch-2.6.16-ck12.bz2
50656 Lona :  well
50661 Myrtis :  duh, Francie =p
50664 Cathi :  but i found one for 2.6.21.2
50668 Gina *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
50670 Francie :  hm, 4 seconds for 1 frame... that's 0.25 fps :D
50671 Cathi :  and i dunno if i need to use the patch on mine
50676 Lona :  Francie: I doubt I'll be playing Doom 128 on this 233Mhz box xD
50679 Myrtis :  hm I suppose remote ssh could work fast with 3d
50683 Myrtis :  i've never tried that
50692 Francie :  Lona, what about doom2? :P
50692 Ana :  i bidded on a c-64 on ebay last week and got out bidded last minute, what i am going to do is make a case mod with a laptop motherboard and do a keyboard matrix and use the 1541 floppy case as a dvdrw and power supply house
50693 Lona :  ROFLMAO
50695 Chantel *  entered the room.
50697 Lona :  Francie: lolololol
50704 Myrtis :  Cathi why are you using patches?
50709 Ana :  and Dav7 here's what your looking for
50710 Ana :  http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=12414&start=15
50714 Francie :  Ana, it has been done before :P except with a mini itx mobo
50716 Lona :  what's that?
50724 Angla :  Myrtis: maybe he just gave up smoking
50725 Cathi :  kevin, i am following a tutorial for this
50726 Chantel :  is there a versio of linux for internet kiosks ?
50731 Ana :  bastards Francie
50738 Cathi :  so im confused, what is the patch exactly for
50738 Lona :  Chantel: all Linuxes can be made into that.
50743 Ana :  its ssh for puppy
50746 Lona :  oh.
50746 Cathi :  cause i found one for 2.6.21 at http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/ck/patches/2.6/2.6.21/2.6.21-ck2/patch-2.6.21-ck2.bz2
50750 Myrtis :  Cathi that's what i'm asking you. why do you need a patch
50754 Arlena *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
50757 Chantel :  Lona: I prefer a ready to go version
50762 Lona :  ah I see.
50762 Myrtis :  there's tons of patches. normally you use them when you need something..
50762 Francie :  Myrtis, seriously man, VNC is better at 3D stuff than nomachine x
50770 Lona :  whoopeee!!
50774 Cathi :  Myrtis i dunno
50777 Lona :  glxgears: Error: couldn't open display '(null)'
50777 Francie :  Myrtis, but nomachine x is a totally different desgin concept to VNC i think
50779 Myrtis :  Cathi then you don't need it
50781 Myrtis :  =p
50785 Cathi :  lol are you sure?
50789 Lona :  ^ glxgears exists on my cygwin!
50789 Lona :  :D
50790 Cathi :  there must be some reason
50791 Ana :  is that what you wanted Lona?
50792 Francie :  Lona, lol, xinit glxgears -- :1
50799 Myrtis :  no, but neither are you, so don't use it
50800 Lona :  Francie: I didn't start xwin yet.
50804 Francie :  Lona, and press ctrl + alt + f8
50808 Francie :  Lona, oh lawl
50809 Myrtis :  don't just use random patches without a need
50812 Lona :  :D
50813 Cathi :  yeh but how do i know i do need it
50813 Cathi :  :(
50817 Felicia :  wtf with this flood of wintendo morons?
50822 Francie :  Lona, you in the dark side, running vt? :P
50825 Lona :  Ana: well, I was preferring to something really really small... something that would start on a floppy
50832 Lona :  Francie: no, Cygwin on Win32.
50833 Lona :  xD
50833 Cathi :  err how do i know that i dont need it
50840 Veronika *  entered the room.
50840 Francie :  why the hell am I sitting here chatting on irc when Im sposed to be doing h/w ?
50845 Angla :  Cathi: make sure you get the nicobrevin patch
50852 Cathi :  nicobrevn?
50861 Cathi :  whats that
50863 Francie :  Lona, seriously, someone needs to make a thing that can run native linux programs on windows, which doesn't cost $700
50869 Levi *  left the room (quit: "Ex-Chat").
50871 Malik :  Francie: call the ops, ask them to ban you :P
50878 Lona :  Francie: I agree.
50883 Cathi :  why are you talkin about windows
50883 Malik :  i disagree
50884 Myrtis :  Cathi http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/kernel/
50885 Lona :  Francie: vmware \o/
50888 Myrtis :  Cathi -ck patches
50889 Malik :  windows must be boycotted
50896 Myrtis :  Cathi again, only use them if you have a reason to
50901 Chantel :  Francie: linux is free :)
50902 Fanny *  entered the room.
50929 Myrtis :  why would you need to run native linux apps on windows
50935 Myrtis :  I can't see many uses for this honestly
50962 Felicia :  see, i'm caught in this f'n dilemma ; i don't know whether to have another cup of coffee, or, wanderr off for a few moments to spank my monkey .. <sigh>
50966 Ana :  well you were talking aboot debian, so i found a puppy fix, its better , we are better to keep one more on the puppy dark-side then release the hounds to the deb's<--it that makes any sense
50971 Fanny *  left the room ("Leaving").
50973 Myrtis :  Felicia O_o
50973 Francie :  Myrtis, because you hate linux but there's just this 1 program that you want and there's no cygwin port for it and when you tried to compile it it didn't work?
50978 Fanny *  entered the room.
51005 Beatriz :  Hate Linux? That's crazy talk.
51006 Angla :  Felicia: coffee and cream is nice
51011 Francie :  Felicia, what's wrong with drinking coffee?
51012 Myrtis :  Francie I suspect hating linux would either cause or be due to some level of linux comptance, which would prevent someone from compiling it properly
51013 Felicia :  heh..
51028 Myrtis :  incompetance*
51030 Myrtis :  heh
51036 Francie :  Myrtis, lol
51043 Rena *  left the room (quit: "Ik ga weg").
51051 Angla :  it's incompetence btw
51064 Cathi :  i find it pretty rare there beeing a program for linux that windows doesnt have that someone needs
51064 Dorotha *  stabs Angla under his vest with a pen
51085 Francie :  all good points
51089 Cathi :  i mean linux apps are much better usually, but windows has a shitload of things, they dont need more programs :P
51093 Myrtis :  Cathi I find that fairly often, but usually it's trivial to run linux or crosscompile the app
51095 Myrl :  Angla: i logged out and logged in again, but still i cant edit the files. any ideas what could be the problem ?
51098 Angla :  Myrtis: how's vigilante these days ? i must look him up again
51114 Myrtis :  Angla he's a alive I think :)
51115 Angla :  Myrl: no. it's very strange
51122 Francie :  seriously though, since linux is free, they should make a full blown linux API for winderz
51123 Francie :  oh but
51124 Cathi :  eitherway, windows users dont deserve the awesome linux apps
51125 Cathi :  :D
51131 Francie :  implmenting unix API on winderz would be hardx
51141 Felicia :  Myrtis: note; a large sea bass can make for a very effective weapon
51155 Francie :  wtf there I go again
51157 Francie :  go away irc
51173 Ana :  hey guys how many people in here use puppy linux?
51173 Myrl :  Angla: anyother ways to assign write permission besides doing chmod 777 :)
51177 Charles *  entered the room.
51181 Myrtis :  here's something you'll be hard pressed to get working usefully in windows: kismet :)
51192 Lona :  roflmao
51207 Angla :  that's that wifi hackeryjackery thing
51215 Ana :  777 is as bad as 666, in permissions
51216 Lona :  kismet?
51223 Lona :  Ana: no it isn't
51224 Arlie :  Myrtis, nah, theres a java face animation page ;)
51228 Chantel :  if setting up a computer to only access the internet, say at a library. and it has a keyboard and mouse is it still a "kiosk" ?
51231 Myrl :  Ana: i know :(
51235 Myrtis :  kismet is the ultimate wireless scanning/survey tool
51235 Lona :  Ana: 777 is much better than 666 :D
51240 Lona :  ROFLMAO
51251 Ana :  Lona i meant if you set it to 777 you'll go straight to hell very quick
51253 Francie :  700 wins
51254 Johnie *  entered the room.
51256 Myrtis :  Chantel the name seems appropriate, yes
51260 Lona :  Ana: why?
51263 Belia *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
51272 Myrtis :  chmod 000 Francie Lona
51280 Lona :  ?
51287 Lona :  uh oh
51290 Lona :  can't run anything!
51293 Lona :  no files O_O
51294 Francie :  lawl
51301 Chantel :  Myrtis: hmmm... the howto's I am finding online are for touchscreen... time for a custom distro :)
51305 Beatriz :  Lona: You shouldn't even be able to read or write. :-P
51310 Ana :  we kind of toughed that in class today, maybe the teacher was on crack, but he said thats complete open everything, full control
51313 Angla :  the new 2.6.23 permissions are in hex. fff allows anyone, anywhere in the world to do *anything*
51315 Lona :  teh pointz :D
51330 Myrtis :  most kiosks i've acutally seen are NOT touchscreen, that's odd :)
51333 Ana :  toughed =tooked
51344 Ana :  tooked=took
51346 Beatriz :  Myrtis: A mouse is a more pro tool?
51348 Francie :  rofl @ Angla
51349 Lona :  Angla: really?
51361 Angla :  no
51361 Myrtis :  Beatriz arguably, yes..
51377 Lona :  Angla: man, I R learning Linux! Please donna confusa me!
51384 Beatriz :  Myrtis: How do you "rightclick" with the touchscreen? :-P
51384 Francie :  Angla, nice try, but most people know that fff in hex means 000 in base 10 or binary
51392 Lona :  Beatriz: many solutions for that
51408 Lona :  Beatriz: one I've seen is to hold a finger against the screen for ~3 seconds.
51410 Myrtis :  Chantel it shouldn't be too hard to only run one program in the window manager, disable most all configuration, disable unneeded network and file access (chroot it too), reset settings when the user walks away, etc
51415 Angla :  Francie: what ? i thought it was 4095
51422 Myrtis :  Beatriz two fingers, like a mac
51426 Myrtis :  or
51430 Beatriz :  Lona: How about dragging something?
51430 Myrtis :  "you don't
51437 Lona :  Beatriz: easy
51446 Evette *  entered the room.
51449 Myrtis :  Beatriz tap then drag, easy to get that one working
51454 Francie :  Angla, f = 0, so logically fff = 000
51454 Myrtis :  or just drak
51456 Myrtis :  drag
51458 Lona :  Beatriz: finger position: touch down, release, tap down again, then drag.
51476 Francie :  hm
51485 Arlie :  Francie, is that why people say f off ?
51486 Lona :  Beatriz: I can confirm that with all touchscreen laptops I've used.
51489 Beatriz :  I still find a mouse being more convenient. ;-)
51493 Lona :  true, me too.
51494 Arlie :  because its 0 ?
51494 Myrtis :  on a traditional touchscreen you'd drag by sliding your finger over the screen while touching it :)
51498 Angla :  Francie: f = 15. so logically fff = 4095. i think you'll find
51508 Beatriz :  Myrtis: So basically you make love to it?
51508 Francie :  Arlie, people say f off because they don't want to say fuck because fuck is too rude
51512 Beatriz :  *grin*
51512 Alison *  entered the room.
51518 Arie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
51528 Arlie :  Francie, now your just being rude
51540 Shantae *  sets channel mode ##linux +o Lona
51541 Arlie :  ;)
51549 Francie :  Angla, I thought f was 0? or is there a difference between f and F?
51554 Shantae *  sets channel mode ##linux +b Francie!*@*
51556 Shantae *  sets channel mode ##linux -o Lona
51559 Lona :  there.
51563 Arlie :  Francie, its 15
51563 Felicia :  dang .. this coffee ain't cutting it ... /me wander off for a few
51573 Melani *  entered the room.
51584 Lona :  Felicia has had Felicia! :D
51585 Arlie :  ....89 ... A = 10, B = 11 ... F = 15
51593 Maxwell *  entered the room.
51598 Beatriz :  I never got that part about banning someone based on nickname.
51602 Francie :  Arlie, ooh html notation uses the same letters/digits as hex but a different system
51604 Francie :  i get it now!
51614 Lona :  roflmao
51616 Arlie :  Francie, its base 16 math
51621 Myrtis :  Beatriz works more on freenode since nicks are registered and ban evasion is easy to spot anyway
51627 Beatriz :  Hexagamadecimal.
51631 Francie :  Arlie, I don't know how to use base 16
51633 Angla :  html uses base 15, didn't you know ?
51635 Kimberely *  entered the room.
51636 Shantae *  does \o/
51638 Ana :  brb later have to make dinner
51641 Lona :  k
51645 Arlie :  Francie, you have 16 digits to play with instead of 10
51648 Ana :  <----is whipped
51652 Lona :  I see.
51657 Francie :  I like base 10 the best, because with based 10 you simply increment the numbers step by step
51659 Lona :  <---- is bored
51661 Myrtis :  I thought html used base 128
51662 Maxwell :  moin
51662 Francie :  1 2 3 4
51669 Sharell *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
51676 Arlie :  base 10 is nice, but not as workable on a binary machine ;)
51678 Beatriz :  Any base works like that, Francie.
51682 Fanny *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
51686 Lori *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
51691 Beatriz :  0 1 10 11 100 101, etc.
51695 Lona :  pfft
51704 Francie :  Beatriz, no, that's incrementing different
51705 Francie :  Beatriz, no, that's incrementing differently
51708 Beatriz :  Nope.
51709 Lona :  0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 :D
51711 Myrtis :  Francie: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b ...
51727 Francie :  :S
51728 Sharell *  entered the room.
51731 Shantae *  can decode 4-digit binary, btw :D
51739 Myrtis :  hmm
51740 Francie :  Lona, go, do it then
51741 Francisco *  entered the room.
51745 Shantae *  would like someone to try him XD
51755 Beatriz :  Lona: Honestly, that's nothing to brag about. :-P It's very simple math.
51755 Angla :  now here's thing : in any base, if you alternately add & subtract the digits of a whole number, if that sum is divisible by the base+1, then the number is too
51758 Nannette *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
51759 Arlie :  1111111111111111111111111111111011111111111111111111111111111111111
51759 Lona :  Beatriz: true.
51760 Fanny *  entered the room.
51768 Arlie :  quick .. whats the number in decimal
51768 Lona :  Arlie: O_O  06:12:27 | * Lona can decode 4-digit binary, btw :D
51769 Francie :  Lona, 0010 0101 1010
51774 Lona :  Francie: please wait
51774 Francie :  Lona, decode that :)
51780 Arlie :  i only used 2 digits ... 0 and 1
51782 Francie :  Lona, NUP cheating, using website
51783 Myrtis :  0111 0111 0110 1000 0110 0001 0111 0100 0010 0000 0111 0011 0110 0001 0111 1001 0010 0000 0111 0100 0110 1000 0110 1001 0111 0011
51785 Myrtis :  Lona
51785 Arlie :  it should be half as easy
51786 Lona :  ikLOL
51792 Lona :  Francie: LOL
51795 Veola *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
51796 Lona :  Myrtis: LOL
51801 Myrtis :  actually wait
51804 Lona :  ?
51807 Myrtis :  well, whatever, you'll figure it out
51811 Lona :  okay.
51815 Francie :  it's a joke XD
51821 Lona :  oh
51826 Shantae *  will figure it out.
51829 Angla :  Angla: so to find if a binary number is divisible by 3, you repeatedly add & subtract the digts, and repeat on the sum etc. if you get 11 or 00 then it's divisible by 3
51834 Elaine *  left the room (quit: Success).
51853 Francisco :  i generated a ssh dsa key thing to work between 2 computers which does but now i want to take that existing public and private key and make it work between more computers?
51868 Mark :  Myrtis, 7-7-6-8-6-1-7-4-2-0-7-6-6-1-7-9-2-0-7-4-6-8-6-9-7-3
51875 Francie :  Lona what say this?
51878 Mark :  does that count?
51879 Myrtis :  Francisco put the public key on any computers you want to have access to
51884 Lona :  Francie: LOL
51887 Francie :  Myrtis, does what say this? count?
51892 Myrtis :  Francie yes
51895 Shenika *  entered the room.
51897 Maxwell :  Francisco: there are plenty of documentation about this!
51900 Theressa *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
51902 Beatriz :  Francisco: Spread the public key wide!
51903 Maxwell :  Francisco: go and read
51903 Angla :  Mark: what's that in 3-s complement ternary ?
51914 Devona *  entered the room.
51915 Lona :  Francie: okay, so my skills are kinda not down pat.
51925 Francie :  Myrtis, hrm, how does four digit binary to alaphabet conversion work?
51926 Mark :  i'm not converting to base 3
51947 Myrtis :  Francie I think I did it improperly, but you seemed to understand anyway so it must be a valid communication format
51952 Shenika :  When I run a program and I get the message "Killed" on a line on it's own, what does it mean? (Georgia program itself didn't print the message)
51954 Lona :  but I did one day draw out the schemetic of a calculator (just the half adder of one) and actually run a number through it :D
51954 Beatriz :  Gah, I need to stop being here. I'm wasting valuable time.
51958 Lona :  LOL
51961 Mark :  Francie, it doesn't, you can only get 16 characters
51970 Francie :  Myrtis, no, I just put it in website, and it worked
51987 Beatriz :  Francie: Then they use 8 and 8 at a time.
51992 Francie :  Myrtis, but the ? actually looked like this: �
51996 Francisco :  yes i am putting the public key in the authorized keys file but i want the other remote computers to use the same private key so that they all work with each other, is that ok?
52030 Beatriz :  Francisco: Yes, as long as you trust the computers (or rather, their owner(s))
52032 Myrtis :  Francie I didn't have a ?
52037 Veronika *  is now known as Veronika
52064 Myrtis :  Francisco you shouldn't use the same private key on many computers, you should generate different keys and put them all in the file
52068 Myrtis :  although, you CAN do it
52076 Francisco :  Beatriz: ok i did that but then when i ssh into the other computers from each other i never get asked the pass phrase but instead the password
52099 Francie :  Myrtis, you decode 0111 0111 0110 1000 0110 0001 0111 0100 0010 0000 0111 0011 0110 0001 0111 1001 0010 0000 0111 0100 0110 1000 0110 1001 0111 0011 using http://nickciske.com/tools/binary.php
52118 Beatriz :  Francisco: Could be a bad SSH setting. Google knows a lot of this (I know, I've had the same problem before.) Go google it.
52137 Myrtis :  Francie "what say this"
52142 Myrtis :  no weird character
52145 Mark :  Francie, thats 8-bit
52201 Regine *  converts everythign to 9.81meters/sec?
52226 Lona :  -_-
52227 Regine *  then divides by avagadros number :-p
52227 Francie :  Myrtis, anyway, how do you convert alphabet characters to binary and vice versa, is there a website that can teach me?
52251 Alina *  entered the room.
52255 Beatriz :  Georgia guy who made that website is out of it anyway. There's no such thing as 8-bit ASCII.
52271 Myrtis :  Francie normally it's done as a binary representation of the ascii code representing the letter
52279 Lona :  Myrtis: that reminds me, how are characters encoded? Binary can only encode numbers, so are the chars converted to ascii and is that then --ah.
52284 Gricelda :  Hello guys, I have to install mousedev as a module instead of statically
52288 Lona :  06:19:19 | <Myrtis> no weird character
52290 Lona :  oops
52295 Lona :  how did that get in there :/.
52297 Arlie :  Lona, font map
52299 Mark :  Beatriz, well its extended-ASCII, it is 8-bit
52299 Gricelda :  can anyone pls tell me what I have to install as a module besides mousedev in order to do so?
52303 Vicki *  entered the room.
52303 Arlie :  Lona, character set
52308 Francie :  Myrtis, yeah yeah yeah but what is the binary representation of each alphabetical character, where is the list?
52309 Lona :  Arlie: oh.
52310 Vicki :  hi peeps
52312 Beatriz :  Mark: "Extended ASCII" is so undefined it hurts.
52316 Lona :  pfft
52327 Vicki :  im using ssh to try and delete a folder that was created by mistake
52329 Lona :  Francie: go look up ASCII table.
52332 Vicki :  im using rm -d
52333 Lona :  (on google.)
52337 Arlie :  Lona, a numberical index into an array of character bitmaps or font description
52340 Arlie :  er..numerical
52342 Vicki :  but prob is folder is called $id
52342 Beatriz :  Georgia ISO-8859-x series, e.g., can be considered "Extended ASCII"... even UTF-8 can be considered "Extended ASCII".
52351 Lona :  yeah :/
52351 Vicki :  and i cant seem to get rid of it
52358 Vicki :  any suggestion?
52361 Roland *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
52378 Mark :  Beatriz, meh i like to use this -> http://www.asciitable.com/
52385 Malik :  Vicki: man rm shall help
52387 Lona :  Vicki: this just occured to me: `mv' the file to /dev/null :D
52393 Malik :  especially the -r and -R keys
52423 Lona :  Mark: welll! I use my own table I wrote myself :D
52427 Caren :  Vicki: rm -r \$id  maybe?
52436 Myrtis :  I don't like to use a table
52441 Myrtis :  I have computers do this stuff for me
52443 Caroyln *  is now known as Caroyln
52444 Myrtis :  makes irc a lot faster
52447 Vicki :  rm -r \$id
52457 Mark :  Myrtis, just take random stabs at it and hope your right?
52487 Myrtis :  Mark normally the protocol in question also indicated the character set in use
52494 Beatriz :  Mark: That's codepage 437.
52527 Lynelle *  left the room (quit: "Ciao").
52536 Caren :  Vicki: that work?
52542 Cathi :  Support for prefetching swapped memory (SWAP_PREFETCH) < should i say yes to that?
52573 Sierra *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
52586 Mark :  Cathi, probably, unless your on a laptop, then it may be bad
52595 Cathi :  i am on a laptop
52597 Cathi :  why is that bad?
52603 Lurline *  is now known as Lurline
52605 Maxwell :  do you know about any utility which allows me to put data starting on specific sector on linux? something like dd and its seek
52606 Caren :  uses the disk a lot more
52612 Cathi :  oh
52619 Myrtis :  Maxwell um, dd?
52619 Mica *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
52620 Cathi :  does it improve performance?
52623 Darlena :  erm... this is just a wild guess, but.. dd
52624 Jinny *  entered the room.
52630 Mark :  Cathi, it should
52636 Cathi :  crap
52636 Johnie *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
52640 Caren :  Cathi: not really... but it stops you running out of RAM
52641 Cathi :  now i dont know what to do
52644 Maxwell :  Kevin: i tried but it looks dd doesnt know 'sectors'
52646 Lurline *  is now known as Lurline
52651 Myrtis :  Maxwell use math
52655 Myrtis :  *512
52657 Darlena :  you have to tell it about them, but it can
52658 Cathi :  so i shouldnt enable it?
52659 Jinny *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
52669 Johnie *  entered the room.
52671 Darlena :  Maxwell set block size to 512 and you will be counting sectors
52673 Caren :  Cathi: yes, i guess
52674 Mark :  Cathi, get more RAM and then you don't have to use swap, and its faster too
52679 Francie :  I wish someone would teach me binary system
52685 Francie :  nobody in IRC can do it
52688 Francie :  but I mean like a teacher
52688 Caren :  Cathi: might reduce batt time, but i think you should do it
52690 Donette *  entered the room.
52698 Mark :  0 1 10 11 100 101 110 111
52698 Francie :  anyway
52699 Darlena :  Francie if you get two nobodies together then you have 3!
52701 Cathi :  okay tell me this, is this usually enabled default?
52706 Caren :  yes
52714 Francie :  Darlena, ha ha, very funny
52715 Cathi :  axman6, you say i should enable it?
52717 Shenika :  Francie: what about the binary system?
52721 Darlena :  Francie I thought so, yes
52723 Caren :  yeah\\
52725 Francie :  Shenika, how it increments!
52726 Caren :  gahh
52727 Darlena :  ikernel try wikipedia
52729 Caren :  dinner! bbs
52733 Francie :  Darlena, Donna though
52742 Darlena :  Francie yes, I am
52746 Cathi :  how about Tickless System (Dynamic Ticks) (NO_HZ)
52775 Myrtis :  Cathi I suspect some programs wouldn't like that
52778 Francie :  Darlena, no, I've tried to teach myself binary before using websites, and I just can't see the relation ship of powers of ten and the resulting numbers
52784 Cathi :  it has no by default
52785 Christian *  is now known as Christian
52790 Shenika :  Francie: basically it's like decimal, only instead of counting up to 9 before carrying to the next digit, you count to 1
52792 Cathi :  i will go with it i guess
52811 Jinny *  entered the room.
52814 Cathi :  High Resolution Timer Support (HIGH_RES_TIMERS) ?
52822 Synthia *  entered the room.
52836 Myrtis :  Cathi http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=651&num=1
52845 Darlena :  Francie that's because there isn't one, maybe ?
52847 Francie :  Shenika, I don't ge3t it
52854 Hoa *  is now known as Hoa
52869 Beatriz :  Francie: Uh, how old are you? You should learn to do other bases in school.
52876 Gricelda :  Can anyone pls tell me what I have to do install mousedev dinamically?
52881 Floy :  when i run 2 instances of rpc.statd on one machine (one with the default machine name and the second with the alias "nfsserver") and then run rpc.nfsd with the hostname "nfsserver", will the nfs server then use the second statd and nfsmount the first?
52904 Cathi :  kevin`, doesnt sound worth it
52909 Cathi :  also, i dont have smp i bleive
52913 Maxwell :  Darlena: dd if=test1 of=/dev/loop1 bs=512 and test2 want to put on sector 2 - should i use seek?
52914 Cathi :  unless a centrino core solo does
52917 Cathi :  but i doubt it
52917 Franklin *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
52918 Myrtis :  Francie I think the problem is that in order to understand how binary and hex work you have to understand what "base 10" means
52923 Rufina *  entered the room.
52931 Myrtis :  core solo means one core right?
52932 Shenika :  Francie: When you count in decimal, you keep incrementing the first digit. But when the first digit gets to 9, you reset it to zero and increment the second digit, yes?
52934 Felicia :  Maxwell: you need seek and skip to match ibs/obs man dd
52935 Myrtis :  so it wouldn't be smp
52936 Odelia *  left the room (quit: Read error: 54 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
52949 Myrtis :  unless it does HT, which is also used by the smp code
52953 Felicia :  Maxwell: you can use xxd to view, man xxd ..man hexdump ..

52973 Maxwell :  scheise - have a meeting
52975 Felicia :  Maxwell: you can use loop and offset to mount it at a specific sector
52979 Maxwell :  laters - and thanks
52980 Francie :  Shenika, um, dunno
52982 Cathi :  yes Myrtis, its just an old core solo, i dont think its smp or ht
52993 Francie :  I think I get it now

53005 Darlena :  Maxwell man dd, it has seek capabilities
53007 Francie :  0, 1, 01, 00, 010
53009 Francie :  is that right?
53019 Myrtis :  does it look right?
53026 Shenika :  Francie: erm, no...
53027 Francie :  don't know, that's what im asking :P
53028 Mark :  no, look at what i said before
53034 Shenika :  the first two are correct :p
53035 Myrtis :  think about it man
53040 Myrtis :  01 = 0 btw
53041 Mark :  Francie, -> 0 1 10 11 100 101 110 111
53045 Malik :  Francie: are you trying to count?
53048 Malik :  01 == 1
53052 Francie :  yes Malik
53052 Malik :  01 != 0
53053 Ingeborg *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
53053 Cathi :  kevin` http://pastebin.ca/506901
53064 Malik :  Francie: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111
53068 Shenika :  remember, the lowest (least significant) digit is on the right, not the left
53069 Cathi :  or anyone else who might know about kernel compiling
53073 Maxwell *  left the room (quit: "leaving").
53087 Francie :  Shenika, same as base 10
53089 Myrtis :  Cathi your actually using make config instead of something like menuconfig?
53091 Beatriz :  Francie: Each digit is twice as much "worth" as the one following it.
53097 Myrtis :  Cathi how much ram do you have
53102 Chantel *  left the room (quit: "If it can't be done with linux, then I don't need to be doing it.").
53104 Beatriz :  Therefore 1 is worth one, while 10 is worth 2 and 100 is worth 4.
53112 Francie :  that creates numerous problems when trying to count in base 10 Beatriz
53114 Francie :  i mean
53116 Francie :  base 2
53125 Cathi :  512mb
53129 Bertha *  entered the room.
53133 Francie :  Beatriz, that would suggest that 1001 is not one more than 1000
53139 Fanny *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
53144 Beatriz :  Francie: No, it's the same in base ten. Each digit is ten times as much worth as the next.
53146 Francie :  Beatriz, in fact, they are totally different numbers
53148 Myrtis :  Cathi go with the default
53153 Beatriz :  Francie: 1000 is 8, 1001 is 9.
53153 Cathi :  choice 1
53154 Cathi :  ?
53155 Francie :  Beatriz, ... oh yeah
53168 Beatriz :  and 1010 is 10 because 8 +2 is 10.
53168 Shenika :  Francie: If it makes it easier, see it like this: 001 010 011 100 101 110 111
53170 Francie :  Beatriz, hm, how does that work, I think i'll read wiki page
53178 Myrtis :  yes Cathi
53208 Francie :  Shenika, I see some pattern... but still, I cannot figure out how to count in base 2 using that
53217 Ashlie *  entered the room.
53230 Myrtis :  you count the same as decimal, only the highest number is one
53232 Julietta *  entered the room.
53236 Wei *  entered the room.
53237 Myrtis :  instead of 9
53237 Beatriz :  Francie: Georgia easiest way I think is to think of each digit twice the worth of the former.
53247 Shenika :  Francie: start with 001. Increment the rightmost digit, and what do you get?
53250 Earleen *  entered the room.
53254 Arlie :  i cant figure out how to count either
53258 Francie :  Shenika, 002 :P
53262 Arlie :  my monkey fingers screw me all up
53263 Beatriz :  Francie: so 1=1, 10=2, 11=1+2=3, 100=4, 101=4+1=5, 110=4+2=6, etc.
53276 Myrtis :  Francie what's one number higher then 9? a?
53279 Shenika :  Francie: Yes, but since we're in binary, we can't have 2, so we have to carry
53284 Felicia :  then figure out the diff between little/big endianess ..lol
53293 Francie :  Shenika, 000 :D
53294 Mark :  100000000000000000000 = 2^20
53295 Francie :  Shenika, 010
53304 Cathi :  any ideas on what frequency i should run at?
53308 Cathi :  default is 1000hertz
53311 Shenika :  Francie: now increment again
53314 Francie :  Cathi, 1000hertix
53316 Francie :  Shenika, 011
53318 Myrtis :  Cathi what type of programs will you be using
53318 Felicia :  open up a friggin scintific calc already
53321 Glayds *  entered the room.
53321 Gricelda :  Can anyone pls tell me what modules do not allow to set mousedev as a module pls?
53322 Nadia *  entered the room.
53322 Cathi :  but i hear that something like 100-250hz save battery
53323 Shenika :  Francie: and again
53323 Nadia *  left the room (quit: Connection reset by Brandie).
53328 Francie :  Shenika, 111
53329 Mark :  Cathi, what speed comp, if its modern go for 1k
53334 Gricelda :  I need to fix this dependency to install mousedev as a module... pls someone help me!
53336 Lavern *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
53340 Francie :  Shenika, ... 1101?
53344 Cathi :  its a intel centrino chipset, core solo, 2ghz i thinkl
53351 Shenika :  Francie: no. You have to carry twice
53353 Malik :  Francie: what about this: 0(10) = 0(2) = 0, 1(10) = 1(2) = 1 * 2^0,  2(10) = 10(2) = 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0, 3(10) = 11(2) = 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^ 0
53356 Felicia :  Cathi: 300 for optinaml audio/video
53361 Malik :  Francie: can you understand it this way?
53366 Francie :  Malik, nope
53376 Myrtis :  Cathi the higher timer frequency is important for some things like video sync, 300 works and is there for that reason though
53376 Beatriz *  left the room (quit: "I can't take it anymore. Gotta work.").
53377 Francie :  brb dinner
53381 Cathi :  Felicia, i was thinking that, sounds like it might increase my battery life
53391 Shenika :  Francie: if you add 1 to 011 you get 012, but you can't have a 2, so you carry and get 020, but you can't have a 2, so you carry again and get 100
53393 Mark :  Cathi, 1K will be fine, i doubt changing it will make any noticeable difference
53398 Felicia :  sure ..
53398 Malik :  Francie: you repleied too fast, you didn't try to understand, because you can't think so fast :)
53408 Glayds *  is now known as Glayds
53410 Cathi :  someone said that 1k can decrease battery life by half
53412 Malik :  s/repleied/replayed/
53419 Malik :  pfft
53428 Malik :  *replied is correct i guess
53446 Staci *  entered the room.
53456 Cathi :  haha you can set it at 10khz :D
53470 Felicia :  why not use base36 anyways ..lol screw this base2 crap ;-P
53472 Myrtis :  Cathi that dynamic hz thing would also help if it actually matters for battery life
53482 Cathi :  too late :p
53486 Malik :  Felicia: do you have a total of 36 fingers? :O
53508 Meta :  arg
53511 Myrtis :  Cathi see, this is why you use menuconfig
53519 Gricelda :  Can anyone pls tell me what modules do not allow to set mousedev as a module pls?
53519 Matt *  should never be a real DJ
53530 Felicia :  Malik: only if you count between the webbings :-P
53535 Gricelda :  I have to install mousedev as a module can anyone pls help me?
53543 Cathi :  kevin, im using xconfig
53544 Gricelda :  I'm in menuconfig but I cannot set it as a module
53548 Staci :  hey, i since ubuntu/debian is .deb based, and fedora/redhat is .rpm based, what is openSuse/NovelSuse use?
53556 Myrtis :  Cathi so why is it too lat? :)
53558 Cathi :  how about this,  Procfs interface (deprecated) (ACPI_PROCFS)
53567 Myrtis :  IMO yes
53570 Felicia :  mousedev is deprecated, use psmouse
53585 Shenika :  Francie: Have you got it yet?
53590 Gricelda :  Felicia, I do not care
53594 Gricelda :  I need that for my touchpad

53676 Myrtis :  Cathi sd card readers will probably be in the mmc section if it represents itself at that level
53677 Felicia :  oh .. hehe macintel .. ya know , the one Apple embraced after YEARS of bashing intel compared to PPC cpus .. lol
53679 Vicki :  axman thanks for the help rm -r \$id worked

53718 Staci :  hey, i since ubuntu/debian is .deb based, and fedora/redhat is .rpm based, what is openSuse/NovelSuse use?
53722 Gricelda :  Mark, I did it, but in order to get the touchpad working like on osx you need to enable mousedev as a module
53733 Myrtis :  Staci I think rpm
53734 Sierra *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
53739 Gricelda :  Mark, and let it load a few modules in a specific order
53753 Sierra *  entered the room.
53762 Gricelda :  May I know now the "super secret way" to get mousedev working as a module pls?
53783 Frida *  left the room (quit: "gone").
53792 Mark :  Gricelda, you need to have all the USB stuff as a module (the HID stuff), then rmmod them on boot, modprobe the apple stuff, then modprobe the USB stuff
53803 Myrtis :  Gricelda grep MOUSEDEV */Kconfig
53812 Mark :  but i think the new patches remove that need...
53813 Myrtis :  not exactly that command, but you get the idea
53818 Cathi :  VIA C7 Enhanced PowerSaver (EXPERIMENTAL) (X86_E_POWERSAVER) [N/m/y/?]

55323 Francie :  somebody try to type in 32 bit binary, I DARE you

55359 Francie :  hm
55371 Francie :  Myrtis, now explain to me what makes that 32 bit :D
55372 Darlena :  Francie the sequence "32 bit binary" does not resolve to anything
55382 Darlena :  Francie we;;, there are 32 bits
55386 Myrtis :  it has 32 bits
55387 Darlena :  that's it
55390 Francie :  rofl
55392 Francie :  I see.
55399 Darlena :  I really, really doubt this
55401 Meta :  damn
55410 Francie :  so my 32 bit processor... how fast can it process 32 bits?
55413 Matt *  really should get more ps2 games
55425 Myrtis :  Francie how fast does it run?
55426 Darlena :  Francie faster than you, obviously
55429 Francie :  2.6ghz
55434 Darlena :  Francie define "process"
55435 Francie :  Darlena, duh, it's a computer
55442 Myrtis :  it can process them.. lol faster then you. anyway at 2.6ghz
55453 Darlena :  Francie yes, and you have absolutely no clue how one works, do you ? :)
55457 Francie :  Darlena, you run a string of electrical processes through a processer, and it does stuff
55459 Caren :  Francie: then it can prcess that in 1/26000000(000?) seconds
55460 Myrtis :  unless it uses more then one cycle for some operations, which cpus do do
55464 Darlena :  Francie erm.. not even close, no
55465 Matt *  bitchslaps everyone with his 800 mhz pentium 3

55504 Francie :  Shenika, he was kidding
55513 Darlena :  Francie the definitions for computer porcessing have nothing to do with electricity - it's *logic*
55529 Francie :  Darlena, ah, yes
55533 Darlena :  Francie just like those elusive binary numbers are at the core of logic
55545 Darlena :  learn one, you start understanding the other
55552 Myrtis :  binary logic is represented quite easily by electrical signals
55553 Francie :  :S
55558 Myrtis :  rather important to see why/how
55578 Bok :  Does anyone know how to replay a UDP packet, specifically an SNMP trap? I have tried capturing the packet using tcpdump and then getting the payload using wireshark then using netcat to send off the payload but nada.
55598 Darlena :  Myrtis that depends on sooo many factors... pipeline length, ALU complexity, cache activity, data IN the cache, where do these numbers come from, etc etc etc
55607 Lorri *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
55639 Darlena :  Myrtis I agree, on the most basic level, but once you get insid eth elogic functioning of a computer bits are all that is important - you can explain the entire thing in the digital realm
55642 Cristi *  left the room (quit: Success).
55648 Francie :  perhaps it is possibly best not to try learning this stuff. it will not be useful to me anyway
55651 Darlena :  which is sort of the point
55661 Caren :  Francie: what are you trying to learn?
55673 Francie :  Caren, im not exactly sure how to describe that :P
55699 Myrtis :  Bok tcpreplay maybe, i've only done this with 802.11 frames, myself, but you'd think the tools would be simple
55714 Francie :  should've made a better core system than binary
55740 Myrtis :  how do you describe something else with electrical signals Francie
55761 Francie :  Myrtis, well, you don't use electrical signals, you use light signals
55763 Yang *  entered the room.
55774 Caren :  Francie: uurrgghh, no
55777 Myrtis :  how do you describe more then two states with light signals then
55796 Elenor *  entered the room.
55797 Yang *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
55799 Elenor :  hello guys
55802 Francie :  Myrtis, but for a human to build such a machine which basics work on that, would be very difficult
55804 Myrtis :  it's the same in either case, but it makes the curcuitry a lot more complex to deal with that stuff
55809 Elenor :  with what package can i edit iso files?
55829 Francie :  Myrtis, hrm, that is what we should have discovered, how to do that
55840 Myrtis :  Elenor erm, mount
55845 Garret *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
55846 Myrtis :  Francie why?
55847 Elenor :  Myrtis: *edit*?
55856 Elenor :  Myrtis: isn't that read-only ?
55862 Myrtis :  what do you want to edit about them
55865 Elden *  entered the room.
55878 Francie :  Myrtis, there is only so much bandwidth that silicon can take, thus limiting computing power
55882 Myrtis :  I don't think it's trivial to change files in an iso filesystem in real time, it's like tar
55884 Elenor :  Myrtis: infinite reasons
55891 Myrtis :  you should just recreate it
55896 Caren :  Elenor: emacs/vim
55899 Francie :  urgh
55901 Elenor :  Myrtis: i don't want to change it in *real time*
55907 Francie :  my stomach hurts like hell
55909 Elenor :  i have the ubunt 7.04 iso
55915 Elenor :  *ubuntu
55926 Elenor :  and i want to change the memtest86+.bin file with a newer one
55930 Francie :  well not like hell but it hurts! haven't had a stomach ache in such a long time
55933 Elenor :  however...
55939 Elenor :  if i copy/paste the files from the iso
55940 Myrtis :  Elenor I mean, in order to change the position and size of files, you have to recreate the image for every change, so it's not efficient to do it like your thinking
55943 Elenor :  and i recreate the iso
55949 Elenor :  i loose the bootable part
55951 Gricelda *  entered the room.
55956 Myrtis :  then you didn't make the iso properly :)
55965 Elenor :  Myrtis: how to make it? :)
55970 Elenor :  that's what i'm asking
55978 Myrtis :  Elenor man mkisofs /el-torito
55989 Myrtis :  maybe they don't have a -
55993 Myrtis :  you get the idea though
56005 Myrtis :  there's three different types of booting you can do from a cd
56015 Myrtis :  and of course you need the boot image itself
56020 Myrtis :  once you have that, you can do whatever you want
56051 Myrtis :  fyi, the options used to create the iso are in the iso image, as well as the boot image
56078 Elenor :  where do i see them?
56096 Francie :  lol
56110 Elenor :  sorry for asking newbie questions :)
56115 Felicia :  ok .. so we all know who rosie o'donnell is, but who's this knocked up elisabeth chick with those beaudacious ta-tas? ;-)
56135 Malik :  Felicia: i don't know who's rossie o'donnell

59333 Latrina *  entered the room.
59333 Arlen :  Elfrieda: the main problem is to find "new lines". the simplest way to do that is to make a copy of the file every time, then count lines in both (using wc -l), then calculate the difference.
59348 Arlen :  this only works if the file crows constantly. if it's rotated, things get complicated
59357 Malik :  Elfrieda: advanced bash scripting guide, man crontab, man wc
59383 Deetta *  entered the room.
59388 Arlen :  alternatively, rotate the file on every run of your script. that's the easiest.
59416 Malik :  probably you might also want to use diff when trying to overcome the rotation issue

I would have sworn the exchange database was only 5-6G. This was raid-50!! and with skip=10000 20000 or 30000 (should be 10G, 20G, 30G) i still keep seeing exchange database all over the place. this is strange to m

66652 Denyse :  Georgene: the interface name is typically assigned by the kernel during init time.  But that doesnt really answer the question.

67672 Berneice *  entered the room.
67694 Luther :  and I dont mean I want everything starting from nano to be distributed among the computers, but rather stuff that supports threading, and/or just running some of the processes on the other computer and some on the other
67707 Corrie :  There are "simple" solutions on a per-app basis.  Georgia complete solutions tend to be open-mosix-like.
67743 Corrie :  Ah.  Georgia threading stuff starts making things hard.  Especially if it's between machines.  Memory image and all that.
67744 Monika *  entered the room.
67760 Luther :  hmm
67774 Dalia :  Corrie is talking about solutions like LAM, which require apps to be written in a specific manner. So you can't run apps that are not LAM-aware on a LAM cluster.
67808 Corrie :  Or you can, they just won't be very parallel.

68086 Ute :  What media player can I use to play Realmedia video/audio files?

68424 Adelina :  it runs with nobody/nobody

68444 Eula :  it appears that apache runs as apache on my system

68591 Anh :  well, anyways, how is it possible to listen on a port below 1024 without root privileges?
68593 Rachel :  Anh: thats why pache must NOT run w/root priv.
68600 Eula :  Anh: 1. ppl CAN configure it to run as root 2. exploits are bugs in software that can a cracker can use to gain root privileges even though it shouldnt be possible

68642 Lona :  "10:53:52 | ##windows: <Geek> hmm"  <-- is that line ironic in what it is? :P
68649 Dalia :  Anh, you can call listen() on that port and then drop privileges.
68677 Dalia :  Lona, check simple "gpm".
68681 Ute :  When I try to play the .rm media file, it says "Georgia player does not have the capabilities to play back this content" and when I go to "Check for Updates", it says "Your player is up to date". What could be wrong?
68682 Anh :  ohh, so it had to have the privileges at some point?
68694 Dalia :  Anh, yes.
68697 Lona :  Dalia: `gpm' doesn't exist either.
68709 Anh :  k, thx
68713 Lona :  Dalia: you can VNC in if you like.
68715 Lona :  ;p
68729 Dalia :  Anh, or it can use the caps module, which allows an app to listen on such ports and have only that privilege.
68744 Booker :  anyone here use munin?

68786 Gene *  entered the room.
68801 Dalia :  Lona, I haven't played with Cygwin in a while... anyway if you can't find gpm (which you probably won't, because gpm is quite useless in Cygwin), try building it from source or using only headers from that package.
68805 Gail *  entered the room.
68817 Gail *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
68819 Dalia :  Or you can try to make that app you're trying to build skip gpm support.

77868 Hermina :  Ceola: like what task manager does in windows?
77900 Rickey :  can someoen tell me what this command does
77901 Hermina :  Ceola: i would think there are no limits.
77902 Rickey :  DIR=$(sed -ne "s:^FIRMWARE_DIR=\([^, ]*\).*:\1:p" \
77919 Sonia *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
77928 Rickey :  and /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent
77932 Enriqueta *  entered the room.
77937 Rickey :  it says to do that in the ipw3945 setup but i cant see why
77949 Cathi *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
77953 Rickey :  that command just creates a prompt /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent >
77977 Ceola :  uniconfomist: well, I run a load testing suite against my web server and it errors with 'ran out of threads'  the maximum available are 380.
77997 Ceola :  sometimes the number is a little higher or a little lower
78039 Lajuana :  Ceola: /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
78047 Kareem *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
78048 Hermina :  Ceola: when you say load testing, tests on how many connections to the web server?

78057 Jacelyn *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
78083 Jamar *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
78092 Ceola :  ok, /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max shows 16380
78108 Ceola :  Hermina: 1000 concurrent connections
78115 Ceola :  is my goal.
78116 Lajuana :  To change that, just echo a new value into it.
78136 Ceola :  ok, that's easy.
78141 Nakesha *  left the room (quit: Nick collision from services.).
78144 Lajuana :  Eg, echo 32000 > /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
78147 Nakesha *  entered the room.
78200 Hermina :  Ceola: is that like having a web forum and have 1000+ users using it?
78204 Arlinda *  left the room ("Coming Back").
78204 Arlinda *  entered the room.
78218 Lajuana :  (this is why /proc is delicious)
78220 Rickey :  does anyone know what this does DIR=$(sed -ne "s:^FIRMWARE_DIR=\([^, ]*\).*:\1:p" /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent)
78221 Hermina :  Ceola: because it's accessing a DB.
78227 Ceola :  Hermina: yeah, but this isn't exactly a web forum :-)
78234 Rickey :  it says to do that in my ipw3945 setup, but it says /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent no file found
78261 Mei *  left the room (quit: ).
78270 Hermina :  Ceola: just curious about the idea.
78272 Ceola :  Hermina: probably off topic for this room, but yes...web server accesses a db.
78279 Lajuana :  Ceola: searches the file /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent for a line starting with FIRMWARE_DIR=; extracts the value after the =; and assigns it to the variable DIR.
78289 Lajuana :  Basic sed.
78300 Ceola :  Hermina: FunkLoad is the suite I'm using...google will turn it up, it's written in python.
78305 Hermina :  Ceola: so shouldn't it be against the DB instead of the web server?
78319 Cheryl *  entered the room.
78320 Jonell *  left the room (quit: "WeeChat 0.2.3").
78332 Hermina :  Ceola: or maybe it's just using the web server.
78337 Ceola :  comes w/ a little xmlrpc server that monitors memory , network etc
78392 Shakira *  left the room (quit: "Ex-Chat").
78407 Bari *  entered the room.
78408 Ceola :  Hermina: well, it does read from the db, but caches a number of the queries.   But there is post processing on the query results after they are returned to the web server.
78411 Hermina :  sounds dandy.  then if that's the max load in linux, how come i see some sites that have 1000+ users?
78412 Lajuana :  Er. That was directed at Rickey, not Ceola.
78423 Hailey *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
78432 Lajuana :  Hermina: that's the max load by default for his system.
78448 Rickey :  toxic frog, i get an error saying no such file firmware.agent
78460 Lajuana :  My -default- max load is 128,000 threads and I have no idea what the effective web load would be.
78464 Hermina :  ah, keyword, default.
78477 Phuong *  left the room (quit: "Lost terminal").
78491 Lajuana :  In practice the max load would be determined both by thread-max and how well the system can keep up with the perofrmance demands.
78504 Lajuana :  Rickey: because the file doesn't exist.,
78513 Rickey :  yeh, but shouldnt it?
78516 Mimi *  entered the room.
78517 Lajuana :  Rickey: presumable, your setup docs should have information about installing or creating it.
78519 Jospeh *  left the room (quit: "Lost terminal").
78590 Hermina :  Ceola: maybe you could change your max load and rerun the test.
78623 Ceola :  Hermina:   to summerize, I simulate multiple concurrent users making requests for a period of time.  500 concurrent users making requests for 30 seconds and see what the response rate is and the load on the server.
78627 Valentin *  entered the room.
78637 Ceola :  Hermina: nah, I'd rather just dilly dally in here :-)

79190 Cheryl *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
79191 Senaida :  with codegen 300W PSU
79198 Senaida :  Becki: IDE
79199 Becki :  lkm = loadable kernel modules
79206 Yesenia *  entered the room.
79212 Becki :  there's been no changes to ide that would cause read errors in about 20 years.
79216 Ceola :  Lajuana: I was able to increase the max # of threads in /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max by echoing, but that did not solve my issue.  I saw a red hat document that suggested checking w/ the glibc build options

79223 Yesenia :  how do you create a user that can access an svn repository, but cannot login?
79232 Becki :  are you sure you have the jumpers right?  also try putting it on its own cable, not shared with another drive.
79256 Senaida :  Becki: it is on his own cable. raid sec master
79261 Senaida :  jumpers are OK
79261 Kareem *  entered the room.
79261 Hermina :  Yesenia: anonymous checkouts?
79272 Gia :  Yesenia: set their shell to /bin/false (or wherever it is on your system), i'm guessing. #svn might know more
79273 Yesenia :  Hermina: that's not a good option
79284 Yesenia :  svn uses PAM
79320 Hermina :  i'm lost.
79336 Becki :  try it on a different controller card, with a different cable...
79340 Yesenia :  Hermina: local.google.com
79346 Hermina :  Randy: you want to load startup modules?
79353 Becki :  buffer i/o errors are usually interface problems or configuation problems, not bad drives.

79465 Dean :  Yesenia: /etc/passwd

79503 Yesenia :  why not?
79508 Dagny :  Does anyone know how to read a complete system BIOS from memory? Using standard methods with dd I can only capture a 64KB window at 0xF0000, not the entire ROM (possibly 1MB) ?
79509 Becki :  why not?  I touch mine all the time.
79510 Matt *  disagrees with Maxwell

79592 Joye *  left the room ("Leaving").
79605 Dean :  Maxwell: yeah, the system command is 'vim /etc/passwd'
79607 Katherine :  Mimi: #hardware maybe.
79615 Randy :  Hermina: well for the moment i just want to know exactly what i need to make my own LKM (eg: symbols, etc...)
79618 Mimi :  im looking for opinions :)
79620 Ceola :  Dean: the app in a testing suite called FunkLoad . written in python.
79622 Mimi :  not channels :)
79639 Dean :  Ceola: Which threading are you using?
79639 Mimi :  Intel 2 AMD 1
79658 Jaqueline *  left the room (quit: "Quitte").
79693 Ceola :  Dean:  I would have to check that.  I am using what my debian/sarge/python uses.
79704 Kitty :  okay guys my startup script deleted my panel that i had how do i create a new panel without an existing one?
79705 Dean :  Ceola: which kernel version?
79709 Hermina :  Randy: the only way i know is by compiling with the kernel.  and then have /etc/init.d/ or something like that loading it at startup.
79720 Ceola :  Dean: 2.6
79728 Lavinia *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
79744 Cordia :  Mimi - AMD!
79746 Dean :  Ceola: okay, it can be either NPTL or pthreads. pthreads will have problems scaling due to lib limitations.
79750 Mimi :  Intel 2 AMD 2
79768 Dean :  Ceola: NPTL less so, but each thread can't take up too much RAM
79786 Ceola :  Dean: lib limitations as in glibc
79794 Dagny :  I used to prefer AMD but since the Core 2 Duo, I've preferred Intel. Don't know there's really much difference for real-world situations though.
79799 Ceola :  ? that was a quetion.
79826 Dean :  Ceola: pthreads I think default is 1024. many distros/ppl have upped that to 4096 - you are more likley to exaust RAM first tho.
79882 Dean :  Ceola: in a 4GB system with MySQL I can't push it much past 4400 threads, but I've not yet tried to specifically tune things.
79887 Ceola :  Dean: would changing the defaults for pthreads be done inside the kernel
79892 Dean :  Ceola: no
79893 Francina *  entered the room.
79901 Dean :  Ceola: pthread libs
79904 Mimi :  Dagny, so AMD or Intel?
79914 Fallon :  I'd like to write some "networked mouse" and "networked keyboard" functionality.  Where would be the most logical and powerful place to hook this into Linux?  Eg. it needs to work with VT's through gpm, just as much as with X11.
79936 Dagny :  Mimi: I'd me more interested in what it can do for me than the sticker on something buried deep inside
79944 Dagny :  me==be
79959 Katherine :  flase
79969 Mimi :  good god
79971 Mimi :  lol
79991 Hermina :  Ceola: just think about myspace.com and their load.  seems like they're using python or something.
79994 Ceola :  Dean: how do I tell if I am using pthread or NPTL ?    maybe running lsof?
79998 Tamiko *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

80393 Hermina :  Alice: really.  'cause it seems kinda hot what they do.

80706 Ceola :  zope rocks!
80713 Denyse :  Hermina: Georgia navt has decided that "desktop fusion"( as theycalled it) hassome promise and is funding research into it.
80722 Denyse :  s/navt/Navy
80734 Alice :  really, about any other language would be a better choice for myspace
80736 Hermina :  Becki: you'd have to be at a certain standpoint to get that meaning.
80738 Marline *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
80743 Candice :  Samuel: that is a bad idea... Georgia MS Windows has that because paying users get the bad ideas they want...
80748 Becki :  I would imagine trying to resize something like a desktop would be very, very ugly.
80757 Alice :  cold fusion is good for people who have no idea what they're doing, have simple needs and don't need scalability
80760 Samuel :  Candice: why is that a bad idea?

80787 Ceola :  language choice generally isn't were problems arrise, it's the programmers
80806 Madison *  left the room (quit: "Konversation terminated!").
80811 Alice :  Ceola, in most cases, this is true.  cfm is an exception.  it's insanely bloated and slow
80816 Samuel :  Candice: that is true, but the increase of usability over decrease of pointer precision (which is negligible in many cases) is quite worth it
80843 Caprice *  entered the room.

80973 Alice :  Hermina, there is more bad code than good written in php, in my experiences
80978 Candice :  Samuel: the problem is not loss of precision -- it is that the X protocol gets broken. If you pay, you break it and keep both pieces :-)
80985 Alina *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
80999 Alice :  doesn't mean php is a bad language, though I would say in many regards it encourages bad habits
80999 Corrie :  more bad code than good written, in my experiences.
81014 Candice :  Samuel: put another way: shrinking the screen means that a lot of pixel become unaddressable by the mouse.
81014 Alice :  probably true
81021 Hermina :  Alice: it's either the people or the engine.
81035 Hermina :  Alice: i'm guessing 30/70.
81040 Jana :  in netstat -a, what does it show in the Recv-Q and Send-Q columns on LISTEN lines?  is it just hardcoded to be 0, or does it actually show something useful?

81779 Dorine *  entered the room.

81963 Julietta *  entered the room.
81978 Laurette :  ok i got this problem... im trying to install linux on my laptop and there are currently 4 partitions, ext3, ntfs, fat16, fat32    fat16 and 32 came with the laptop(which has XP on it) i want to get rid of one of them to make a swap partition

82082 Hermina :  Laurette: do you care what's on that partition?
82089 Fallon :  Laurette: that's just a matter of running up fdisk, and changing the partition type to Linux Swap, which is type 83 I think.  And then doing a mkswap on the partition.
82106 Lisa *  entered the room.
82111 Fallon :  Laurette: assuming you just want to zap it, preserving nothing.
82118 Laurette :  Hermina i have no idea whats even on those paritions, i cant access them with XP

82133 Hermina :  Laurette: refer to Fallon.

82267 Laurette :  k
82276 Laurette :  i like stuff with GUI since I noob

82409 Fallon :  Grrr ... *somebody* must know how to hook new devices into the HI.  But it's too noddy a question for LKML.
82423 Felicia :  Rickey: what the heck are you talking about?
82429 Belia :  Laurette, you can probably see which is the restore partition by the size... On this laptop it was about 9gb in size

82518 Felicia :  no .ko though .. go look at that file
82523 Fallon :  Belia: bloatware is essential, the entire economy of the west would collapse if it were eliminated ;-))))))))
82537 Laurette :  Belia thankss for the info, i dont think ive ever used quickplay either so if i get rid of either its fine :D
82541 Hermina :  yah.  bloatware rocks.

82610 Rickey :  Felicia, what do you mean?
82611 Felicia :  dell usually has a fat16 (24-48MB) hidden Diagnostics partition as first
82619 Rickey :  Felicia, should i put ipw3945 and ipw3945d in there?
82626 Fallon :  Delorse: joke.  .22 is currently being worked on ;-)
82628 Hermina :  Delorse: the number.  it's very high.
82648 Belia :  Rickey, ipw3945d is a daemon, not a module, just ipw3945

83520 Jesse :  Rickey: you are using the driver that needs the daemon? if so, is the daemon running?
83522 Belia :  Hmm... Is it possible for an intel based laptop not to have any sensors detectable by lm-sensors? Or have I screwed something up?

83584 Jesse :  Rickey: ah...
83586 Rickey :  so that means its sort of working on boot?

83613 Jordon :  Does anyone in here know why the mail command would be haning for 2 minutes

85130 Leota :  Hi all
85131 Lorene :  Jeanice: no when i install Georgia new it is not working i have sh errer
85140 Leota :  anyone know how i can get nvidia to use its agp?
85161 Leota :  i removed agpgart from the kernel and nvidia isn't even compiling the nvidia_agp module
85162 Lorene :  Jeanice: im Using backtrack When i install the Driver in the first time it is Done but now no !
85168 Jesse :  Rickey: sorry,I was afk - write an init script for it
85199 Lucio :  Leota: are you sure your card is AGP?  not PCI-e or pci
85215 Graciela :  Meta: In that case, let me dig in to my bag of tricks. I have quite a collection of audio manipulation software, I'm sure I have something lightweight in here.
85218 Leota :  and the nvidia readme says:  Please note that NVIDIA's internal AGP support cannot work if AGPGART is either statically compiled into your kernel or is built as a module, but loaded into your kernel (some distributions load AGPGART into the kernel at boot up).  Default: 3 (the default was 1 until after 1.0-1251).
85223 Jeanice :  Lorene: then try nvidia-install --uninstall
85224 Felicia :  Horacio: do you happen to know, if one compiles from vanilla sources, can they then grab the distro-source package and use m-a?
85230 Lorene :  ok
85232 Rickey :  Horacio, i found that typing ipw3945d starts the daemon
85239 Rickey :  should i add that to etc/modules
85242 Felicia :  Horacio: erm.. the distro-source for that module in question
85245 Leota :  Lucio: yea its an agp 8x fx5200
85246 Jeanice :  Lorene: nvidia-installer, sorry

85517 Regenia :  I have 2 distros on 2 partitions, and the 3rd will be /home, but the same user is on both distros, and I want to make a seperate folder for each distro's home/user. Does that make sense?

85558 Regenia :  Katelynn: bind in fstab? is that the type versus ext3 or is it an option?
85560 Felicia :  Jeanice: sure .. but only if you compile in tux support for swearing, cursing you out and BEEPing at you
85564 Leota :  Regenia: yea then add a mount point for /home in fstab for the third partition
85581 Regenia :  Leota: yes but then they will share the same user folder.

85673 Regenia :  like that?
85702 Felicia :  Rickey_: look at your ipw3945 startup scripts .. the more newer your n00b00b00 version the worse it deviates form the standard /etc/init.d/ dir
85723 Katelynn :  Regenia, /var/websites/home.com  /home/joe/home.com  none  bind 0 0

85763 Lucio :  Leota: is CONFIG_AGP=m and CONFIG_AGP_NVIDIA=m in your kernel's config?
85782 Fallon :  There's no need to mess around with fstab for relocating /home.  Just "mv /home Somewhere/home" and "ln -s /Somewhere/home /home".
85788 Felicia :  Rickey_: usually/sometimes daemons are forked off from the startup script (with an --option) ..but in this case, no friggin clue ... maybe run depmod and update-modules .. (just a guess)

85826 Leota :  # CONFIG_AGP is not set
85831 Regenia :  Fallon: Yea but- i'd rather not make links if I can help it. I'd rather centralize it in fstan
85834 Felicia :  Rickey_: man pages man, man pages

85856 Remona *  kills man pages
85858 Jarrett *  entered the room.
85863 Leota :  Lucio: how can CONFIG_AGP_NVIDIA=m  end up in the kernel? don't you install using the nvidia installer after the kernel is built?
85874 Jesse :  Rickey_: normally, you'd write an init script, but you could probably just stick it in /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
85904 Lucio :  Rickey_: what distro?  sysv types start apps in /etc/rc?.d/S##_script to start my app (or a link to one anyway)
85912 Fallon :  Regenia: hehe, funny, as I'm always seeking to decentralize. :-)  Otherwise you have to remember what you've modified every time that you update the distro.
85913 Felicia :  Hermina: ~/.bashrc, or ~/.bash_profile for enabling while login
85916 Meta :  hey Graciela thanks for the programs
85918 Cathi :  shadow, ubuntu
85938 Regenia :  Fallon: I suppose its 6 one way, half a dozen the other way...

85965 Jesse :  Hermina: ~/.xsession
85988 Lucio :  or maybe man ipw3945d will show you other ways to rig it.

87310 Felicia :  Regenia: modprobe deals with depmod, whereas insmod/rmmod doesn't

87314 Angelic *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
87334 Regenia :  Felicia: yea so if any modules were depending on ndiswrapper, rmmod would fail

87605 Dreama :  try deleting it and then recreating it...?

88241 Novella :  Horacio, i trying to make ndiswrapper work , and it has worked for me before upgrading to edgy, there is no GNU under /etc/iftab or /etc/network/interfaces but when i depmod -a and modprobe ndiswrapper and then iwconfig it lists lo eth0 sit0 and GNU ( GNU seems to show the things that my wireless card has), is it possible to make ndiswrapper use other things than wlan0?
88244 Elli :  :)
88248 Felicia :  heh
88252 Angla :  it's like huck finn turning cartwheels outside becky's picket fence, to get noticed

88447 Fidela :  Minh: what did you expect it to do?
88449 Felicia :  stop complementing me!
88449 Jesse :  Novella: now I actually read your question, perhaps you can use ifrename and /etc/iftab to rename the interface
88455 Felicia :  :-p
88463 Novella :  Horacio, how do i do that
88489 Elli :  Why is it that when you get a new computer, your old box that was fast enough suddenly seem slower then a turtle in a desert
88492 Sharlene :  Krystle: Georgia WebUI has HTML pages represented.  With WGET you'd probably be just submitting <form> tags and setting the POST variables in the form...  kind of like:

88696 Minh :  Sice I already use the output I cannot just echo the variable and catch it outside
88696 Krystle :  Toxic: Time to digg man pages.
88697 Salvatore :  sarah: i dont if its configured to lan boot, and i dont have any pxe servers configured

88776 Krystle :  Sharlene: do you have to auth for every page?
88779 Jesse :  Novella: #ubuntu
88788 Novella :  i remembered to make a copy but i typed cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces_backup after i changed and saved so it is useless

88870 Fidela :  Minh: ls | (while read x; do y="$x + $y"; export y; done; echo $y ) good enough for you?
88871 Salvatore :  i found the megaraid drivers on the gentoo website, can i use this http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/linux-patches/genpatches-2.6/tags/2.6.15-1/4351_megaraid-compatibility.patch?rev=247 for any other 2.6 kernel?

88986 Jessika :  so none knows the problem?
88994 Fidela :  Minh: ls | (while read x; do y="$x + $y"; done; echo $y ) I meant.
89004 Arlinda *  left the room ("Coming Back").
89004 Arlinda *  entered the room.
89014 Elli :  Salvatore, it might work for other kernels, but you need to keep in mind it's made for a specific kernel
89016 Fidela :  Minh: the trick is ( ), within the brackets you're in the same sub-shell and y is always available.
89024 Erik :  I need to create .mov files. What can I use to do this?
89031 Rickey :  who knows bash scripting well
89034 Angla :  Jessika: what the dickens are you mumbling about ?
89051 Salvatore :  Elli: so check which kernel the install disc uses then find a corresponding driver?
89059 Siobhan *  entered the room.

89097 Elli :  Salvatore, yeah, or try patch the kernel you have
89106 Rickey :  does anyone here know bash scripting :(?
89106 Jessika :  Angla: let me repeat myself.
89108 Fidela :  Rickey: DESC=Intel ipw3945 wireless daemon
89111 Angla :  Rickey: the owner of #bash, greycat knows a trick or two
89111 Jessika :  Hey hey, got a question here, for some reason mysql isnt shutting down for me when i turn of my linux system ( gentoo ), all i get is "shutting down mysqld (0)", and the shutdown process more or less hangs.
89113 Fidela :  Rickey: should be quoted.
89119 Jesse :  Erik: actually, a glance at TFM suggests mencoder can create them
89127 Sharlene :  Rickey: meee :)   greycat is 10x better than me though at #bash like Angla said
89129 Rickey :  Fidela, thats just the name though
89139 Salvatore :  and i can burn drivers to a cd instead of putting them on a floppy?
89141 Fidela :  ye, script will fail there though to start with
89144 Erik :  Horacio: Well, I'm not familiar with how to use mencoder.. hm.

89184 Minh :  tyvm
89192 Fidela :  Minh: ne time
89195 Fidela :  gtg &
89200 Salvatore :  how hard is it to patch a kernel with the drivers i need?, i dont have linux on the machine, so i would want to patch the install kernel
89200 Minh :  Now I got my ulocate script :)
89201 Rickey :  Fidela, should it be like that for ipw3945d as well?
89214 Felicia :  Rickey: someone knowledgeable already offered helped and asked you questions, but you're too busy toeven notice

90530 Rickey :  right?
90539 Jesse :  Melody: real is wallclock time, user is time spent in userland, and sys is time sent in kernel-land

90543 Sharlene :  Rickey: yeah.  I'll pm you my email

90738 Shad *  entered the room.

93090 Boris :  if i knew i'd be good
93095 Rickey :  anyone know how i can check whats wrong?
93120 Aurelia :  if you're trying to generate certs, there's millions of sites on it, not to mention the manpage specifies how to generate other hashes/encryption methods for data
93153 Krystle :  Sharlene: just wget --no-check-certificate --http-user=admin --http-password=xxx https://192.168.0.95

93243 Arlie :  someone actually replied with the details of the apcupsd NIS protocol
93245 Delia *  entered the room.
93261 Aurelia :  I couldn't tell for sure what the problem is with your current one

93318 Aurelia :  how did you generate it?
93344 Arlie :  Corrie, wake up
93345 Boris :  i didn't generate it - for our application server, we usually take certs from people with certs signed by a trusted authority.  this cert is self signed
93351 Boris :  we got this from a user
93387 Aurelia :  tell him to generate a new one, if it's self signed it probably won't make much of a difference (some of their users might have accepted the self signed, but most browsers won't let you save self signed these days)
93414 Kacy *  entered the room.
93425 Kacy :  hrmmmm
93441 Kacy :  there is a command to boot another kernel when you're already in a linux system, basically from the command line .... anyone can tell me what it is?
93445 Kacy :  it slipping my mind
93455 Boris :  does that error msg indicate his self signed cert is not 'pem encoded'?
93470 Arlie :  Kacy, i saw it in the kernel build options 2 days ago
93480 Arlie :  Kacy, i dont remember what its called tho ;(
93496 Aurelia :  probably Boris
93498 Rivka *  thinks
93507 Sharlene :  Krystle: if you're wondering how I'm doing this is using a Firefox extension called "Tamper Data" that gives you all of the FORM variables for when you submit a form.  You could also look inside of the <input> fields inside of the <form> tag in the HTML source code of the page...give me 2 minutes and I'll have it ready :)
93540 Nicki :  the web developer extension has that (and lots of other stuff, too) I find it quite useful

94494 Lajuana :  There's also Xubuntu, which uses XFCE.

94510 Simona :  what's XFCE?
94515 Oliver *  entered the room.

94769 Mitzie *  entered the room.
94803 Lajuana :  Rosanne: exactly.
94855 Sharlene :  Krystle: you may want to go something like:   `wget -O readthis #blah balh`  and then `vim readthis` and see what it says in response.
94859 Reiko :  Would it make for a decent release to run server apps, squid, ftpd, etc
94862 Kacy :  btw ... does anyone see these characters  => ????  or just question marks?
94875 Reiko :  question marks
94877 Jesse :  Kacy: I see question marks ;)

95875 Irwin :  what is the difference between egrep, fgrep and grep. I've heard egrep is better suited for regular expressions, but i havent really noticed any difference
95906 Danielle *  left the room (quit: "Sto andando via").
95923 Garth *  entered the room.
95950 Christene *  entered the room.
95950 Lajuana :  Irwin: grep uses BREs, egrep uses EREs, and fgrep uses plain substring matching.
95952 Priscila :  Irwin: egrep uses ERE, grep uses BRE, and fgrep is for fixed strings.
95992 Irwin :  AHAAA IC
95993 Irwin :  thanx
96002 Lajuana :  Georgia difference between EREs and BREs basically being that in BREs, characters are normal unless \escaped, and in EREs, characters are normal only if \escaped (at least for those characters that have special meanings)
96030 Christene :  hi all, if i want to chroot in my home directory on some red hat server, i need to create /dev and /bin and such in my home directory, but mount --bind has to be done by root.  is there a command to do the same thing as non-root?  ie with symbolic links?
96065 Sharlene :  \escaped gets really confusing sometimes and it's best to have a reference handy.  Because something escaped in egrep, may not be escaped in Vim's version of Regexp
96072 Irwin :  Lajuana: Thanx =)

96146 Nikita :  i'm in the proccess of planning a linux server (using ubuntu server os).  can anyone reccommend a webmail app?
96153 Lajuana :  Christene: symlinks won't cut it since they reference by name (and thus stop working inside the chroot); and you aren't allowed to hardlink directories.

96156 Edyth *  left the room.

96188 Christene :  add what?
96192 Sharlene :  Irwin: I would recommend getting one of those nicer thick pieces of paper, writing the important languages down, and then getting the paper laminated.  Getting a paper laminated only costs a dollar at the printing services at my local community college.
96199 Lajuana :  Christene: the mount --bind calls.

96291 Lajuana :  Christene: hrm. This could be a problem, then.
96302 Lajuana :  You could recursively hardlink~
96313 Lajuana :  (assuming it lets you, not sure what permissions restrict ln)
96324 Arlie :  laminated paper is a 70s thing
96335 Lajuana :  apt-get doesn't have options to use non-default directories?
96339 Dreama :  anyone know of a good online tutorial for cross platform programming?
96341 Lavinia *  left the room (quit: "Quitte").
96342 Irwin :  Arlie: and still it amazes me =D
96344 Sharlene :  Lajuana: excellent URL resource ty :)

96369 Maricruz :  who is a Linux exp?
96370 Krystle :  Sharlene: i pm'd you some new info
96377 Maricruz :  i've a exp question
96387 Sherri *  entered the room.
96389 Sherri :  Hello:)
96395 Maricruz *  is now known as Maricruz
96395 Justa :  how do i set my default gateway in /etc/conf.d/wireless?
96396 Nicki :  Maricruz: just ask
96400 Maricruz :  ok
96401 Christene :  i assume an apt-get option exists to change install root, but it's buried in the config docs somewhere.  yum has it right on the command line --installroot=blah, but it doesn't seem to be working
96405 Maricruz :  i need something special
96422 Maricruz :  not the same distro but the fastest distro on the web
96428 Maricruz :  something simple and fast
96445 Nicki :  they are all about the same speed. :)
96456 Dreama :  netconfig didnt work Justa?
96464 Sharilyn *  entered the room.
96469 Bruna :  gentoo i guess
96473 Bruna :  for speed
96484 Maricruz :  i need to run a linux desktop on a 133 Mhz pc, with 64 mb of ram
96485 Earle *  left the room (quit: ).
96486 Christene :  Dreama: stick with standard C and C++ and cross platform programming is fairly straightforward
96487 Maricruz :  this is the problem
96490 Nicki :  Bruna: not speed of install, though, :)
96490 Justa :  Dreama: what is netconfig?
96495 Nikita :  i'm in the proccess of planning a linux server (using ubuntu server os).  can anyone reccommend a webmail app?
96495 Mitzie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
96507 Mitzie *  entered the room.
96507 Dreama :  you run netconfig and it helps configure your net devices
96509 Bruna :  well if you do it right you only do it once ;)
96524 Sharlene :  Krystle: I didn't get the PM
96526 Christene :  Dreama: if you're using C++, especially look into the Boost libraries because those are cross platform up the wazoo
96530 Lajuana :  Christene: WRT yum, --installroot is just the -install- root, not the database location or anything, which are configured seperately
96531 Bruna :  DSL would be pretty fast too
96536 Nicki :  Nikita: squirrelmail
96539 Dreama :  Christene: I'm working on a network app in C that needs to be portable to windows from nix
96545 Maricruz :  dsl? its a distro?
96549 Christene :  ah, system calls
96552 Bruna :  damn small linux?
96554 Dreama :  network and system level stuff
96561 Lajuana :  Dreama: use standard BSD sockets; there are wrappers from that to Winsock
96568 Sherri :  my 2.6.20.11 kernel source fails to compile with the following error log : http://sial.org/pbot/25109
96573 Arlie :  sort of
96575 Lajuana :  (whereas the converse are harder to find)
96576 Sherri :  I tried searching google and got 2-years old results
96586 Nicki :  hrm, I used to run redhat 4 on a pentium 133 many mango seasons ago. :)
96588 Dreama :  noone knows of a online reference for just standard cross-platform coding standards?
96590 Christene :  yeah.  the cross platformness of that is dependent on which system call genre you need
96590 Maricruz :  mmm seems nice... it has a window manager?
96591 Olimpia *  left the room (quit: Operation timed out).
96598 Emogene *  entered the room.
96599 Nicki :  that was back when you could choose "redneck" as an install language
96611 Justa :  Dreama: i dont have netconfig and i dont need it either (only need one more entry and im done) i know how to set it manually with route but i need to know how to do it from the conf file
96615 Arlie :  winsock isnt 100% compatible with bsd sockets
96621 Arlie :  theres behavioral goofyness
96628 Arlie :  as well as the winsock init stuff
96637 Sharlene :  Dreama: just use functions that are available on every platform :)
96644 Kary *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
96647 Bethann *  is now known as Bethann
96652 Dreama :  yea, thats what im trying to do
96657 Arlie :  its close tho, but fair warning, windows bsd socket interface sucks ... its 2.5 times slower than linux
96662 Dreama :  but i want to make my functions/obj's as portable as possible
96680 Irwin *  is now known as Irwin
96683 Nicki :  use java :)
96689 Dreama :  ah fuck java
96693 Sharlene :  lol!
96694 Dreama :  java should of stayed home
96715 Dreama :  we can start using java once the rapture begins, then its gravy
96759 Lakisha *  entered the room.
96760 Christene :  how many system calls are you thinking you'll need to be cross platform, and how complicated is your usage of them?
96762 Krystle :  Sharlene: so you cant get pms?
96765 Priscila :  java pwnz
96765 Krystle :  (not that one)
96774 Lane *  entered the room.
96775 Emogene :  how can i ping a website and request the webpage's contents in response to the ping
96793 Emogene :  i looked through the man pages but couldn't figure it out
96821 Lane :  u wanna see the webpages contant in console
96822 Dreama :  as of right now the system stuff is only with network sockets but i am planning on some stuff that will be very much more, like working with nix system files, win registry, devices/drivers
96824 Arlie :  ping and HTTP have next to nothing in common
96824 Dina *  left the room (quit: "this is just some wasted space").
96842 Arlie :  Emogene, wget will get a url
96844 Angla :  apart from the fact they both have 4 letters
96845 Dreama :  there is no icmp ping to get http
96845 Dianne *  entered the room.
96852 Dreama :  you can run wget
96864 Arlie :  Emogene, so if your making a script or something, ping and wget are the commands you want
96868 Christene :  you have a nightmare in front of you then Dreama.  that's not a tutorial you're looking for, it's a framework
96877 Dreama :  i know lol
96884 Dianne *  left the room ("Leaving").
96888 Christene :  maybe GTK does all those things, but i'm not sure I haven't used it
96890 Dreama :  thats why im starting in linux, where i know almost one forth of what i want
96906 Maricruz :  thanks for the DSL tips
96910 Sharlene :  wget 'http://whatever' ; [$? -eq 0] && echo 'Web page existed.'
96912 Kary *  entered the room.
96915 Nikita *  left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
96921 Dreama :  but i want to be writing portable code from the start and work on the low level sys stuff as i learn more
96924 Keesha *  entered the room.
96925 Arlie :  Dreama, if its any help, i made a socket framework that supports tcp,udp, and unix sockets, all in seperate modules that work by themselves, or, through a 4th module called "usocket" for universal socket
96940 Dreama :  c?
96944 Sharlene :  Emogene: look at my last chat line
96949 Keesha :  hi all can someone tell me how can i configure mail server on redhat
96952 Christene :  and why are you using C?
96953 Arlie :  Dreama, yes, each module exports the same api
96964 Temika *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
96966 Dreama :  cross plat?
96973 Arlie :  Dreama, that way, you can make server apps that work over all 3 protocols using a single interface
96983 Arlie :  Dreama, not atm, but theres no reason it cant be
96984 Sharlene :  Emogene: some web sites BLOCK ping's, but have port 80 wide open.
96985 Christene :  C++ is cross plat; what are you trying to run on, embedded shit or something? :)
96987 Dreama :  yea, thats what ive been coding for the last couple days
96997 Arlie :  Dreama, you cant have it ... im just telling you how i did it ;)
96997 Dreama :  mind dcc'n me it?
97003 Dreama :  ah damn joo
97008 Keesha :  hi all can someone tell me how can i configure mail server on redhat
97009 Emogene :  so i have a home network that i redirect to a login page... through apache... there is supposedly a way i can bypass the login page, because by forwarding all traffic thats not registered on my site to this page, i also allow pings.  is there a way i can automate this process of capturing a webpage through a ping?
97015 Dreama :  hell, i'd just use libnet for that
97022 Kathie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
97026 Keesha :  ??
97026 Dotty *  left the room (quit: "bye bye").
97028 Keesha :  hi all can someone tell me how can i configure mail server on redhat
97033 Garth *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
97039 Lane :  o:-)
97043 Arlie :  Dreama, your not much of a framework developer if you just use libnet
97055 Dreama :  there is no way to capture anythign except a ping/icmp from ping
97056 Keesha :  hi all can someone tell me how can i configure mail server on redhat
97058 Madalene *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
97059 Kary *  is now known as Kary
97061 Arlie :  Dreama, and besides, libnet doesnt have a shared memory segment that emulates a socket
97065 Sharlene :  Christene: not everything is best programmed Object Oriented you know :]
97079 Simona *  left the room (quit: "bonne nuit. bonne nuit to you all").
97084 Sharlene :  Christene: And you can do OO in C
97088 Sunni *  left the room (quit: ).
97092 Emogene :  is the response to a ping not just any other incoming packet... and i'd assume datagram?
97100 Dreama :  shiiz, i got a lot of learnin ahead of me
97115 Dreama :  a ping is a icmp echo request and response usually
97126 Christene :  I absolute agree Sharlene, but C++ simply has better syntax and even using it for procedural programming vastly reduces errors relative to C, unless you're a guru programmer
97131 Ava *  left the room (quit: "return Demetra;").
97138 Angla :  Keesha: you are not worthy of any assistance. reflect on that
97146 Christene :  i don't mean syntax so much as standard library
97154 Sharilyn *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
97156 Belia :  Sharlene, you can pretend you're doing OO in C
97180 Moira *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
97181 Sharlene :  Belia: my imagination is boundless :)
97185 Priscila :  Sharlene: wget blah && echo exists
97191 Carlita *  entered the room.
97197 Dreama :  i don't understand how c++ oo is any more efficient or better than oo in c, tho oo supposobly doesnt exist in c
97198 Hallie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
97203 Keesha *  left the room ("Leaving").
97209 Janine *  left the room (quit: "KVIrc 3.2.5 Anomalies http://www.kvirc.net/").
97223 Sharlene :  Priscila: aahh brilliant! I'm going to use that next time.
97244 Arlie :  C++ has true inheritance ... but as far is it being more efficient, in terms of binary size or performance ... nope
97256 Dreama :  other than a few more complicated scope shiz in classes i think c objects work just as well
97259 Kary *  entered the room.
97299 Christene :  um, c++ is much better prepared to do things like inheritance, polymorphism, simple data structures, not to mention generic programming
97299 Nilsa *  entered the room.
97302 Angla :  YOU are number six
97302 Dreama :  i thought a executable only loaded a object into memory whenever the app needed it...
97326 Luetta *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
97326 Dreama :  ah yea, forgot about inheritance and morphism shit
97334 Christine *  left the room (quit: "Chatzilla 0.9.77 [Firefox 2.0.0.1/2006120418]").
97337 Dreama :  man, same diff as copy paste lol
97345 Dinorah *  entered the room.
97353 Dreama :  oh no it overload .text
97354 Arlie :  C does simple data structures just fine
97359 Dinorah *  left the room ("Leaving").
97360 Arlie :  dont pretend C++ is any different
97364 Emogene :  but polymorphism and inheritance actually give you performance gains over copy paste right?
97378 Dreama :  i dont think so, maybe and probably tho ;)
97381 Christene :  i meant data structures not like "struct" but like "vector" and "set" and "map"
97390 Emogene :  multimap
97399 Sharlene :  It's so difficult to tell if a kitten is male or female
97400 Arlie :  Christene, C gives you all those just fine
97400 Emogene :  hehe
97413 Emogene :  yeah
97415 Laree *  entered the room.
97422 Christene :  and how is that Arlie?
97424 Emogene :  but why fuck with it in c when you can fuck with it in c++
97429 Laree :  why does netcraft say that apache has been dropping in usage over the past... 2 years? :-/
97432 Emogene :  stl is nice
97436 Arlie :  Christene, its the Leta of libraries
97437 Laree :  http://news.netcraft.com/
97460 Tamar *  entered the room.
97473 Christene :  what library are you referring to that provides such structures?
97474 Kacey *  entered the room.
97503 Dreama :  if apache is dropping than what is going up?  not iis
97503 Krystle :  Sharlene: can you give me a working command line for the wget command to go off of?
97506 Nicki :  Laree: that guy who owns 300,000 parked/typosquattnig domains uses windows? :)
97517 Tora *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
97517 Arlie :  Christene, supermagicklib
97530 Krystle :  Sharlene: like maybe for another site, just for proof of concept
97536 Hallie *  entered the room.
97537 Sharlene :  Krystle: aahh sure :)
97548 Maia *  entered the room.
97551 Krystle :  Sharlene: because its working when i retype it in
97560 Christene :  um was that serious Arlie?
97560 Maia :  hey people, anyone knows a program to ocr barcodes from image files?
97568 Belia :  Krystle, wget google.com
97573 Krystle :  Sharlene: but the variables on the box dont get changed like they would if i logged into the webui
97575 Dreama :  ocr scan?
97584 Krystle :  kth: for posting data
97589 Sharlene :  Krystle:  http://rafb.net/p/0cZQWp63.html
97600 Nicki :  Maia: there are some perl modules for it, oh wait, I'm thinking about generatnig barcodes
97603 Dreama :  o optical character recognition... dunno why i just thot of that
97612 Soraya *  left the room (quit: "Have you mooed today?").
97618 Latrina *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
97619 Arlie :  Christene, no ... i dont feel like argueing or explaining it ... C++ used to be a C pre-processor macro expansion ... the code was actually converted into C ... at least, when C++ first began ... so to claim C++ does all sorts of shit C cant do is really a stretch
97623 Avery *  left the room (quit: "Saindo").
97631 Arlie :  you just like C++ syntactical sugar coat
97634 Dreama :  don't all barcodes have theyre labels, the numbers, right under the bar?
97650 Latrina *  entered the room.
97660 Sharlene :  Krystle: what you're doing may require extra work.  Like some of the POST variables may be different on the browser you use when you're logged into the webui that way.
97663 Arlie :  Dreama, upc does
97676 Arlie :  Dreama, but thats just 1 barcode, not all of them
97678 Maia :  Dreama: I have a image file, I need the numbers in a machine readeable format.
97679 Dreama :  oh, didnt know there was diff kinds
97694 Maia :  it's easyer for a machine to ocr the barcode than the numbers.
97695 Christene :  C++98 is far superior to the original C++, just like C99 is far superior to original C; and yes, the syntactic sugar makes code easier to understand, extend, and reuse
97701 Krystle :  Sharlene: well there is a reboot button that happens after you hit apply, how would you "click" that?
97706 Sharlene :  Krystle: because like the POST variable 'passphrase' is blank...maybe it's not suppose to be blank lol
97711 Christene :  without sacrificing performance since it's still compiled to native code
97717 Sau *  entered the room.
97723 Arlie :  "far superior" is another stretch of the truth
97748 Nicki :  Maia: are the images generated programtically, or pcitures taken with a camera/scanner?
97755 Arlie :  and it does sacrifice some performance ... just not much
97767 Sharlene :  Krystle: you'd have to see what the reboot button does.  You'd have to read the JavaScript that gets called when the button is clicked.  Then you'd have to mimick the button-clicking behaviour in a WGET call lol
97770 Dreama :  http://sourceforge.net/projects/jocr/
97774 Christene :  that's just nonsense.  prior to 98 you couldn't rely on the standard library actually being the same on every platform, which meant using C++ in the way C is most often used was impossible
97777 Dreama :  Maia
97781 Leda *  entered the room.
97781 Sharlene :  Krystle: I'll look at the HTML you sent me and see if I can track down that reboot button
97807 Dreama :  i'm always suprised that c++ is in use
97809 Arlie :  Christene, solidifying the standard libraries has nothing to do with the language itself
97814 Krystle :  Sharlene: If I login to the webui, change a few fields, hit apply, then logoff, then relog back in, those changes are still there.
97836 Dreama :  c++ is like a trench coat on natalie portman
97839 Nicki :  Dreama: that's just for readnig text, though, I think
97846 Christene :  you can have that opinion if you want Arlie, but my opinion is the standard library of any language and its performance is extremely important
97849 Krystle :  Sharlene: that's without rebooting. However, doing the wget to change the fields, logoff, then login through a web browser, the commands aren't changed.
97851 Arlie :  Christene, anyway ... im done ... ive had this arguement a million times ... a million and one is too many
97851 Mirta *  entered the room.
97858 Maricruz :  Dreama: what language do you suggest?
97872 Dreama :  perl n C and asm every now n than
97874 Belia :  Just program in brainfuck and get it over with
97881 Nicki :  bf++
97885 Dreama :  c++ maybe for video games

98011 Belia :  Not even close Laree ;)
98014 Berneice *  left the room (quit: ).
98014 Dreama :  Maia: if you read the numbers in you can just use a barcode font to generate the barcode again
98015 Laree :  Belia: ?
98030 Maricruz :  i start to program with gfabasic with amiga workbench 1.3
98033 Maricruz :  :D
98037 Laree :  Dreama: barcode in, barcode out? :)
98047 Dreama :  yea i dont know, he asked not me

98084 Maia :  Dreama: I need a OCR software that recognices the barcode that is in the image
98085 Dreama :  yea, shouldnt http://sourceforge.net/projects/jocr/ do that?
98093 Laree :  Priscila: someone should make a programming langauge that's graphically based rather than ASCII graphically based. :)
98104 Nicki :  Maia: are the images generated programtically, or pictures taken with a camera/scanner?
98107 Laree :  Priscila: for instance, just like BF, but using GIFs instead. :)
98115 Arlie :  Laree, its called UML ;)
98115 Maia :  Dreama: I don't know I was asking for a good recomendation, I see gorc, ocrad, etc

98142 Maia :  come from sane
98155 Dreama :  oh, i'm not sure than.  only barcode stuff ive worked with was a hardware scanner that would copy the barcode number to the clipboard when you scanned it
98158 Augustina *  entered the room.
98187 Melody :  is there any way i could open thunderbird in workspace 2 on startup?
98194 Rochel *  entered the room.
98198 Nicki :  yeah, I've also only used a scanner that translated the barcode into a number for me
98203 Dreama :  your scanner reads in the whole image?
98215 Priscila :  Laree: they did, piet
98218 Maia :  I'm ussing a image scanner, not a barcode scanner.
98221 Maia :  sorry for the confution.
98234 Laree :  Priscila: heh
98235 Dreama :  probably could using ~/.xorg edlt
98247 Maia :  In fact, currently I'm ussing both, first I scan the barcode with a barcode scanner, and then I scan the image with a image scanner.
98254 Dreama :  why?
98261 Maple :  Has anyone ever use this 25gig free storage site www.mediamax.com, because I'm trying to use it with linux but its screwing up
98262 Maia :  I want to kill the barcode scanner step so the process can be fully automatized

98303 Sharlene :  Krystle: that should reboot the router
98312 Maia :  Dreama: I need the image, that's the whole point, the barcode is just to clasify that image.
98329 Sharlene :  Krystle:  add the command-line option '-S' to wget to get the server response...it might be handy:

98353 Maia :  If the image can autoclasify itself with out typing or reading the barcode (by example by ocring the image for the barcode) that would save a lot of time.
98353 Dreama :  did someone kidnap you and force you to do this Maia?
98364 Signe *  entered the room.
98370 Maia :  Dreama: I'm getting pay to scan thoses images.
98379 Sharlene :  Melody: look up thunderbird command-line options
98382 Dreama :  tell them it is dumb to save the barcode image
98397 Maia :  Dreama: I'm not scanning just the barcode image.
98400 Kenya *  entered the room.
98408 Dreama :  oh
98409 Nicki :  apparently th eimage is not just of the abrcode, but the whole side of the item?

98431 Kary *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
98442 Maia :  Dreama: It's a whole document, it just contains a small barcode.
98444 Nicki :  yeah, so program has to find barcode within image, and then ocr translate it to numbers
98459 Maia :  that's right
98462 Yolande *  left the room (quit: "Lost terminal").
98463 Dreama :  ah k

98599 Sharlene :  Maia: are you using a program that interprets the bar code?  and actually reads the bar code?
98601 Rochel :  how can i set a daemon to start at login?
98622 Nicki :  Rochel: what distro?
98627 Sharlene :  Rochel: on login?  or when the computer first boots up?
98631 Rochel :  Nicki, debian
98634 Maia :  Sharlene: I'm looking for a program to do that.
98645 Nicki :  Rochel: man update-rc.d
98658 Sharlene :  Maia: when the program looks at the bar code...what do you want it to do?
98665 Rochel :  i wanna start scmpc, a scrobbler for mpd, so its better to start with the current user
98667 Nicki :  Rochel: also look at the README file in /etc/init.d
98671 Lajuana :  Rochel: /etc/profile?
98676 Lajuana :  Nicki: that's for boot, not login
98683 Maia :  Sharlene: read it, and output it somehow in text format (convert from image to text)

98693 Rochel :  i know how to execute at boot
98708 Rochel :  /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
98713 Rochel :  but i want on login
98754 Lajuana :  Rochel: consult the shell docs. In particular, bash will run /etc/profile on login, as well as stuff like ~/.bashrc
98760 Otha *  left the room (quit: "Lost terminal").
98775 Lajuana :  But check the docs to make sure you have a handle on "start on login" and "start on shell open"
98789 Moira *  entered the room.
98796 Lajuana :  Since you presumably don't want another copy of the daemon started every time someone opens an xterm.
98811 Madalene *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
98815 Sharlene :  Maia: bar code to text?  I'm having a hard time figuring out what the output will visually look like...you mean like ASCII art of the bar code? lol
98821 Sau *  is now known as Sau
98828 Lajuana :  That said, there's probably a more elegant way, but I can't think of it offhand.
98830 Maricruz :  with the shell, whats command show me every device?
98847 Lacy *  left the room (quit: "Fui embora").

98862 Lajuana :  Sharlene: presumably, he means the number encoded in the barcode
98869 Zena *  entered the room.

98925 Aida *  entered the room.
98933 Aida :  hi all
98933 Maia :  http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxrecognition that code may do the trick, I just need to canibalize it
98939 Maricruz :  its not a so simply question, i'm trying to format a virtual disk with DSL in qemu, and the live cd is so... empty :D
98948 Cristina *  entered the room.
98969 Lajuana :  Maricruz: if you're looking for a disk, try /proc/partitions
98972 Danyel *  entered the room.
99019 Maricruz :  dsl help say to use cfdisk, but he continue to tell me that he cannot read the disk
99023 Zella *  left the room (quit: "Don't let gravity get you down").
99035 Sharlene :  Maia:  I have an idea of what you can do.  In java you can get the pixel array of an image.  Use that to figure out WHERE the barcode is at in the image.  Then you can crop the barcode out (because the barcode has the color white in a rectangular block), then resize it to standard size.  Then go through, horzontally, pixel-by-pixel figuring out the black lines and how thick they are...and use that data input Alesia to figure out the
99035 Sharlene :   encoded numbers...
99035 Kathi :  anyone know any distributions that'd support openmosix easily, just tried to get it working with debian, but etch is atleast too "new" to support it, the 2.4.x kernel(with openmosix patches) refuses to compile with any of the compilers same as the (alpha stage) 2.6.x openmosix
99060 Brianne *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
99074 Kathi :  and by easy I mean that it works and it's possible to get it installed without 3 weeks of debugging and similar
99076 Maia :  Sharlene: yeah, that would be to much work, I'm looking for something already done :P
99078 Malvina *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).

99153 Joshua *  entered the room.
99155 Darlena :  Rochel that's not easy to answer as it depends on many factors
99161 Bruno :  Darlena: not really true.
99167 Lewis *  entered the room.
99168 Joshua :  hi everyone
99173 Angla :  firestarter
99183 Maricruz *  left the room (quit: "ChatZilla 0.9.78.1 [Firefox 2.0.0.3/2007030919]").
99197 Darlena :  Bruno yes, it is - what if he has an allow all policy and denies what he fears ? or what if he uses a gazillion custom chains that throw packets around until nobody can follow them anymore ?
99198 Rochel :  i just want to open the mirc ports and the 5222 for google talk
99199 Sharlene :  Joshua: hello Linux friend lol
99215 Darlena :  Bruno I refuse to answer iptables questions without a look at the current setup, simple
99224 Bruno :  Rochel: i have recently written a small set of scripts for making networking easier to handle, without all the fuzz firestarter & co introduce... have a look here: http://brightbyte.de/page/Linux_networking_scripts
99240 Krystle :  Sharlene: i believe the scripting fails because of the quotes
99247 Darlena :  yes... thereby replacing his setup with yours - also one of the greats
99248 Oneida *  entered the room.
99249 Rochel :  Bruno, ill take a look, tnx
99249 Maia :  haha, the CueCat ..
99255 Bruno :  Darlena: fair enough
99263 Krystle :  Sharlene: it's saying every time that https://192.168.0.95/whatever doesn't exist
99274 Darlena :  Bruno the simple fact of the matter is that it is never easy unless you stick to one and only one tool to do it all
99282 Bruno :  Rochel: use at your own risk, i'm not a wiz, just have been using linux a while
99285 Darlena :  Bruno and I have not yet come across one that qualifies
99290 Angla :  using iptables in the raw when firestarter is available is putting your computer's security at risk. end of story
99302 Rochel :  Bruno, ok
99310 Darlena :  Bruno do you know if anybody took the trouble to implement a Cisco-ish interface to iptables ? because that is a standard, of sorts
99319 Sharlene :  Krystle: Well that's weird...if it works for a regular browser it should work for wget...somehow.
99352 Norbert *  entered the room.
99354 Maegan *  entered the room.
99365 Bruno :  Darlena: no idea what the cisco-ish interface is :) I have for a long time been thinking about a more structured way (syntax) of expressing firewall rules though, basically as nested if-then-else.
99370 Darlena :  if iptables has one major shortcoming it is that it does everything with one interface... access control and routing should really not be mixed unless there's a very, very good reason
99386 Bruno :  Darlena: anyway, have a look at the scripts i linked to above, they work quite well for my limited needs.
99396 Sharlene :  Krystle: perhaps try using this command-line option with wget:   -U "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.2; Linux)"
99400 Aida *  left the room (quit: "Leaving.").
99414 Darlena :  plus, it does not distinguish between interfaces when it comes to incoming and outgoing traffic - so you have to put access control and the interface in a rule, which is kinda.. sicko
99417 Sharlene :  Krystle: in other words...I'm out of ideas..I doubt your router is blocking you because you're using wget lol
99436 Sharlene :  Krystle: Well...at least the wget User Agent name
99437 Darlena :  Bruno will do
99447 Kathi :  so, anyone know any distroes on which it'd be atleast semi-easy to install openmosix on?
99463 Darlena :  there is a knoppix cd for it
99463 Delmar *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
99476 Aida *  entered the room.
99476 Kathi :  yeah, well, clusterknoppix seems to be from 2004
99477 Voncile *  left the room (quit: "This computer has gone to sleep").
99483 Darlena :  take half a dozen pcs, pt cd in, boot, set it up, go
99492 Darlena :  and the problem with that is ?
99499 Sharlene :  Kathi: probably any distro. I believe most distros have apt-get available, therefore:  `apt-get install openmosix` should do the trick.
99512 Darlena :  Sharlene it's not nearly as simple as that
99519 Oneida :  can someone tell me how can i remove the information from my name such as country, etc inirc
99525 Darlena :  Sharlene mosix needs specific kernel functionality, and tuning
99527 Kathi :  Sharlene: for example debian etch didn't work like that, nor did it work manually
99531 Krystle :  reboot.sh: line 6: wget --no-check-certificate --post-data=reboot_ap=1 --http-user=admin --http-password=x 'https://192.168.0.95/ureboot.htm': No such file or directory
99537 Oneida :  can someone tell me how can i remove the information from my name such as country, etc inirc
99545 Krystle :  Sharlene: maybe you understand that part betterthan me
99545 Darlena :  Oneida if your country is in your nick then you probably put it there
99554 Carlita *  left the room ("Time makes no sense").
99564 Kathi :  Darlena: well, I guess it's worth a try
99567 Kathi :  if I can't figure out anything else
99576 Oneida :  no other information like my ip, dsl etc also goes in irc
99586 Kathi :  Darlena: you happen to know if that clusterknoppix is installable on hdd? or should I just go and search for more info
99593 Darlena :  Oneida yes, your DNS hostname is part of your identity on IRC
99611 Darlena :  Kathi not know, sorry - but every other knoppix was, so... it could be

99715 Oneida :  ??
99736 Aida :  j=-o
99748 Sharlene :  Krystle: It sounds like you're struggling!  This is good!  Struggling => learning :)
99751 Bruno :  Oneida: the country is guessed from your ip. your ip is visible by resolving your host name.
99761 Krystle :  Sharlene: Yarg.
99771 Krystle :  Sharlene: almost there
99778 Bruno :  Oneida: you can hide that info by getting an irc cloak. not sure what the procedure for that is around here. i have one from #wikipedia-de

99938 Kallie *  entered the room.
99952 Kathi :  Alisa: AFAIK it's not extractable, it's just a binary image
99959 Alisa :  Oh wells.
99962 Kathi :  you can use it to burn a boot sector for a cd or similar
99973 Lizeth *  entered the room.
99974 Cordia :  Sharlene - i take it you dont lift much weights :-P
99975 Sharlene :  Bruno: man-in-the-middle.  Georgia IRC data you send goes to the proxy, then the proxy sends the data to the actual IRC server.  Georgia IRC server (i.e. freenode) thinks your IP is coming from the proxy...so the proxy hides your IP address.
99989 Sharlene :  Cordia: yes! lol
99997 Kathi :  Alisa: if it's just a few MB in size, it's propably just the boot sector binary file that you can't really use for anything but making bootable cds etc
100003 Cordia :  hehe
100022 Bruno :  Sharlene: yea, but how does xchat come woth a proxy? and what for? you mean you could proxy through me, or something?
100022 Devin *  entered the room.
100026 Clorinda *  entered the room.

100135 Sharlene :  Bruno, if you had a proxy server running on your computer, I could connect to your computer and do something like deface a Web site.  Georgia Web site owners would look at the Apache HTTPD logs and find YOUR IP address that did the damage.  But then what you could do is say "hey I had a proxy server running", and look at those logs on your machine and find out that it was me that logged into your computer...and then I get to go to p

101607 Laurene :  owned :P
101643 Katie :  Felicia if it was a desktop none of this would be a problem but with laptops fitting an ordinary floppy or CD drive isn't really feasible

102008 Sharlene *  entered the room.

102239 Felicia :  Katie: you realize you have alt-f2..f4 available?
102239 Katie :  Bruno yeah, screen or multiple terminal windows are better though
102245 Arlie :  if someone from an ip address isnt authorized to connect, and keeps trying to connect, it can add an iptables rule to block them with the firewall
102245 Duncan :  mmmm, vpns are fun
102246 Oretha *  entered the room.
102266 Arlie :  if they keep trying to connect still, it can take some other action via a script
102268 Azzie :  Arlie: That would mean your server is running as root.
102279 Arlie :  Azzie, not necessarily
102283 Sharlene :  Bruno, Glennis: when you have multiple programs in the background, get a list of them by typing `jobs`.  If you want only a certain background process to come to the background, go `fg %1`, or `fg %2`.  Georgia # correlates to the background process #.

102314 Azucena :  hi there

102324 Arlie :  Azzie, i could run the iptables control daemon in another process if i wanted to
102333 Felicia :  Arlie: it's called denyhosts
102338 Azzie :  I rpefer my method
102340 Arlie :  Felicia, what ?
102345 Azzie :  lol
102347 Felicia :  Arlie: who?
102358 Arlie :  Felicia, you mean /etc/hosts.allow and hosts.deny ?
102363 Felicia :  no
102365 Corine :  is there anyway to make less always display the first line of input (so when you scroll its always there, for tables and such)
102366 Mirta :  CNN was pretty tonight
102366 Azucena :  guys, I'm running a linux box with kde on college, but do not know which distro it is. I don't have access to any terminal
102370 Felicia :  it's a .py script
102376 Arlie :  Felicia, pfff ... screw that
102379 Azucena :  Is there a way to run a terminal in any different way?
102386 Azucena :  I would like to compile something
102400 Mirta :  charles manson - beating of 91 year old man - the sleepwalker case - wth? slow news day huh?
102413 Arlie :  Azzie, theres a userspace iptables filter
102426 Felicia :  Arlie: or do it manually with iptables http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187
102440 Arlie :  Felicia, dude ... your not right in the head
102452 Azzie :  Hrm
102459 Azzie :  You learn something new every day.

102574 Malvina *  entered the room.
102584 Arlie :  during a DoS or DDoS attack, you dont want to be wasting time doing that crap
102602 Fabiola *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

102614 Fabiola *  entered the room.
102622 Inge *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
102632 Arlie :  so the server doesnt have to do with your connection attempts anymore, it gets blocked by the firewall
102637 Arlie :  er...deal with
102649 Arlie :  after X amount of time, it removes the rule
102663 January :  News from kernel.org: 2.6.21.3: stable <http://www.kernel.org/kdist/fragments/stable.html>

102674 Azzie :  YES! I WILL!
102674 Arlie :  if you keep trying to connect, or connections are comming it at a certain rate, it could then run a script to email you or take some other action
102715 Azucena *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
102727 Arlie :  anyway, its just a small performance enhancing method to alieviate some of the overhead involved when under attack
102739 Angla :  Azzie: they are getting *really* desperate now. i think microsoft will make their biggest loss ever this year
102752 Arlie :  microsoft hasnt ever made any money
102759 Arlie :  all they've done is screw their investors
102773 Azzie :  Angla: Not after they bring out the MS police yelling at XP users to buy vista or be a sissy.
102779 Azzie :  lol
102806 Angla :  "every time you boot linux, a kitten dies"
102820 Arlie :  ballmer is so going to ruin the illusion Eartha g has careful created

102861 Inez :  greetings fellow Linucists.
102871 Arlie :  Inez, i just spelled it out ... read your scrollback
102877 Arlie :  Inez, oops
102882 Sharlene :  Arlie, oh doh.  I read your comment directly after you said you had an idea.  Nevermind :)

102914 Arlie :  Adriana, your paying attention, right ?
102960 Arlie :  Azzie, as for the iptables thing running as root, thats not a big deal, since all it knows how to do is deny connections
102967 Mack *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).

103038 Shad *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
103041 Kacy *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
103046 Arlie :  Azzie, it wouldnt use tcp as a control channel
103060 Arlie :  Azzie, it would use a unix domain socket
103075 Arlie :  which means someone would need to already have access to your box to talk to it
103093 Azzie :  hrm
103100 Azzie :  but if they have access as just a user?
103116 Sharlene :  Arlie, how do you detect whether someone isn't authorized to connect and keep connecting?  A real-time log file analyzer?
103119 Arlie :  they wont be able to connect to the unix domain socket ... the file permissions would prevent it
103134 Azzie :  Well, then.
103159 Merna :  WORD!
103162 Mack *  entered the room.
103172 Arlie :  Sharlene, the server im working on is for an encrypted remote tcp link
103207 Merna :  big calculator
103226 Arlie :  but molling over enoufs suggestions just gave me another idea anyway
103240 Arlie :  which is to use dynamic iptables rules in the first place
103258 Arlie :  and then no unauthorized users ever get past the firewall to begin with
103263 Merna :  tha was cool
103269 Melida *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
103306 Arlie :  then i can just detect the bad addresses, using a moving average calculation for the frequency of occourance, and take some action at a threshold
103331 Merna :  mhhhh
103337 Merna :  and a switch
103355 Arlie :  Felicia, thanks ;)

103428 Arlie :  Lakenya, hurry up and get an account damnit
103431 Regine *  is always happy to oblige linux users/devs
103436 Lakenya :  Arlie: debug encryption?
103452 Arlie :  Lakenya, debug the encryption protocol .. not the algos themselves
103485 Sharlene :  Arlie, is this a kernel module? :)
103495 Arlie :  Sharlene, no ... i dont go in there
103502 Felicia :  (exceptions exist though) .. their names are novell and suse and whatever other crap worms it's way in
103521 Arlie :  iptables already has a userspace filter
103528 Mack *  left the room (quit: Success).

104411 Priscila :  Corine: { is ERE
104419 Priscila :  Corine: sed works with BRE by default.
104421 Corine :  ERE?

104554 Sharlene :  Fernando, http://rafb.net/p/myjskQ19.html  keep this close by you at all times.  But only keep the languages you use.

104604 Armand :  er, files
104623 Corine :  Priscila, awesome thanks
104641 Felicia :  there's an app called shock-the-monkey
104649 Sharlene :  Armand, not much.  You could download QEMU to run Windows XP on a Linux machine, and then install Flash MX on it.
104673 Darlena :  Armand from scratch ?
104696 Garrett :  Darlena thanks dude
104710 Hailey *  entered the room.
104715 Fabiola *  entered the room.
104730 Darlena :  Garrett so where did you get the idea that something was taking all of your cpu ?
104742 Armand :  Well basically I'd like to make a rather simple quiz I can embed in a webpage
104753 Garrett :  i see it Darlena http://filedropr.com/display/MjA2NjQz
104754 Melody *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
104760 Benny :  if a server program listens to all interfaces by default, and i want it to listen to only local connections, do I have to use a firewall, or is there a wrapper program that non-root users can run to restrict it to only local connections?
104762 Garrett :  see 96.0%si
104764 Felicia :  Seee Meee
104770 Sharlene :  Armand: but there are some premade SWF files that do special things.  A special thing might be like playing video FLV files, or an image displayer.  You'd configure the general-purpose SWF files by sending them variables through HTML.
104773 Gail *  entered the room.
104777 Felicia :  Heealll Meeee
104778 Garrett :  Darlena on the Cpu line
104783 Felicia :  Touch meeee

104806 Felicia :  er Heeel meeeeee (2nd should'vve been Hearrrr)

104848 Garrett :  Darlena the box is swapping like crazy,. it's cool i got it from here
104858 Sharlene :  Armand, flash would be an overkill as far as I'm concerned.
104867 Darlena :  Garrett if it's *swapping* then you have a memory problem, not a CPU one
104881 Garrett :  yes i see that

104915 Arlie :  Colene, your trying to drum up customers, in a FOSS channel ?
104918 Darlena :  and how do you know it's swapping ? it's only using 100Megs or so of your 256
104925 Gail *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
104932 Felicia :  Listening to you, i get the music .. gazing at you  ...... i feel the heat .. following you.... i climb the mountains, i get excitement -- at your feeet ..

104962 Nelson *  entered the room.
104963 Garrett :  Darlena i'm thinking- (6% si
104964 Armand :  well the site I want to do it has disallowed javascript. Of course it's not very important. I'm curious how advanced svg is.
104971 Garrett :  si/so = swap
104981 Sharlene :  Benny, depends on what you want local connections for.  For mySQL it has an option to Bind to Localhost.  This means that mySQL would only accept connections from 127.0.0.1/localhost.
104982 Caren *  left the room (quit: "Lost terminal").
104984 Darlena :  Garrett no
104986 Felicia :  swap one ass for another
104995 Darlena :  Garrett if you don't know, please ask, don't guess
105003 Armand :  of course svg isn't supported by default on ie.
105007 Darlena :  Garrett si means Soft Interrupts
105013 Benny :  i know some program can be configured to listen to only local connections, but this one can't
105023 Darlena :  Garrett which could be I/O related, run dtstat to find out
105038 Krystina *  entered the room.
105053 Armand *  left the room (quit: "Lost terminal").
105066 Sharlene :  Armand, disallowed javascript?  You mean like myspace?  SVG is static vector graphics in XML format.

105170 Priscila :  Garrett: install it!
105174 Katie :  but a firewall or modifying the app code (if its availible) is almost certainly easier
105185 Sharlene :  Benny, you can submit a bug report and ask them to add an option for binding to localhost.

105276 Colene :  Arlie:  i wsa just asking if anybody had some pointers?  you cant al be starving as much as i am for  $$

105794 Arlie :  Colene, get a job as an electrician
105798 Avelina :  ok i installed linux onto a hardrive, then disconnected that drive and installed vista onto another hard drive.  Now i have the linux drive as pri. master, and vista drive as pri. slave.  I'm using the grub map (hd0) (hd1), etc commands to try to boot vista (which worked with XP), but its telling me "INVALID SYSTEM DISK".  what gives?

106513 Sharlene :  Darlena, I was just simply listing some protocols for discussion.
106518 Darlena :  Sharlene of that list, only TCP, UDP and ICMP and ARP are, actually, internet protocols - none of which understand text
106531 Darlena :  Sharlene thanks for trying to show everyone your gee^H^H leetness...
106554 Sharlene :  Darlena, your welcome :)
106554 Darlena :  Sharlene yes, so discuss them - I'm not going to bother, we could be here all year long

106789 Avery *  left the room (quit: "Saindo").
106793 Angelika :  GTS*
106801 Son *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
106807 Margery :  Angelika: I'm getting the same thing... whats your proc?
106814 Margery :  intel or amd?
106832 Avery *  entered the room.
106834 Cora *  left the room ("Leaving").
106850 Margery :  I'm stuck between a intel quad core and an amd, prolly 6600
106861 Vicente *  left the room (quit: "Lost terminal").
106868 Angelika :  an Intel core 2 duo E4300
106883 Angelika :  lol, mine is a little low I suspect
106883 Katie :  Felicia sure, the machine is getting upgraded to etch now
106893 Angelika :  2Gb RAM :)
106896 Natosha *  entered the room.
106899 Margery :  Angelika: I hear they're gonna drop the price on quad cores, that should be awsome
106899 Angelika :  SATA XD
106905 Katie :  the only reason for installing sarge was etch's lack of support for usb floppy drives (due to the increased size of the kernel)
106908 Bettie *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
106916 Angelika :  yea, will be nice to have a quad core some time soon
106917 Arlen *  entered the room.
106923 Margery :  Angelika: my plan is 2GB with expansion slots for 4
106926 Natosha :  I am running a 64-bit set-up, and currently have 2 * 1GB DDR800 RAM, would Linux have a problem with me adding 2 * 2GB sticks?
106941 Margery :  Natosha: I doubt it
106942 Darlena :  Natosha not linux
106946 Angelika :  http://www.hispazone.com/contnoti.asp?IdNoticia=2291
106952 Darlena :  Natosha just make sure you run a kernel that has bigmem enabled
106955 Natosha :  doubt I will get dual channel
106956 Angelika :  http://www.hispazone.com/imagenes/noticias/2291-2gr.jpg
106959 Roxanne *  entered the room.
106964 Na *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
106966 Avery :  exist any program to fix all permissions ?
106974 Angelika :  is Q6600 quad core???
106974 Darlena :  yes
106976 Roxanne :  whats the environemnt variable used to search fro shared libs when an app starts
106976 Angelika :  I dont know
106981 Avery :  I have do chmod -R 777 /home
106982 Roxanne :  I want to add /usr/local/lib to it
106986 Katie :  Darlena i thought bigmem was just a hack for large memory on 32 bit systems
106989 Avery :  I am have many problems
106998 Darlena :  Roxanne ldconfig, man that
107000 Angelika :  in that page they say it will be in Jul 22
107003 Katie :  i wouldn't have thought that a 64 bit kernel would have needed anything special for big memory
107004 Arlinda *  left the room ("Coming Back").
107004 Arlinda *  entered the room.
107005 Margery :  Angelika: thats awesome
107025 Darlena :  Katie no, you're still crippled by the PC architecture - that is what it has to overcome
107041 Angelika :  if you can wait a month or so ;)
107049 Roxanne :  Darlena, ah yes ld.so.conf.
107050 Angelika :  I cant wait... I dont have a PC right now at home XD
107051 Darlena :  if you don't set it, no PC system will ever give you more than 1 GB
107057 Roxanne :  Do I have to run something after I update that file
107060 Margery :  Angelika: that sucks
107062 Darlena :  Roxanne ldconfig
107070 Angelika :  yea
107074 Margery :  Avery: whats the deal?
107082 Son *  entered the room.
107100 Angelika :  I donate my PC ... lol
107103 Darlena :  Katie well... "64 bit" is a bit of a... cheap shot, really
107105 Angelika :  or some like that... XD
107110 Angelika :  to a parent
107123 Avery :  Margery I want a program to repair all permissions in system
107137 Margery :  Avery: I have a freind who just converted to linux, and he was trying to fix his permissions, he ended reinstalling his OS, so don't go crazy
107144 Cherlyn *  entered the room.
107145 Avery :  want permissions standard
107148 Darlena :  Katie all current 64 bit intel x86 architecture cpu's still only have 32 /36 address lines, so 4GB is still the upper limit in 32 bit mode, and you need kernel settings for anything over 1GB
107173 Margery :  something like sudo chmod -R 777 /home/you/.* can reset your entire computer, and linux doesn't like that
107176 Darlena :  Avery doesn't exist, stop whining
107192 Darlena :  Avery if you've messed up your permissions then that's a good lesson - don't do that again :)
107194 Avery :  then I have install linux again?
107206 Darlena :  yes - save /etc and /home and re-install
107212 Vanda *  entered the room.
107213 Avery :  I can do backup of my permissions?
107218 Avery :  ok then
107220 Avery :  thanks a lot
107222 Vanda *  left the room.
107223 Darlena :  what would be the use > they're screwed *now*
107230 Daryl *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).

107267 Sheryl *  entered the room.
107269 Shameka *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
107285 Margery :  Darlena: thats lame, why don't they expand the address lines while they have the time... I mean, will 128 bit lines not fit on the MB?
107292 Laraine *  entered the room.
107305 Darlena :  Margery you don't understand... it's a little bit more complicated than that
107314 Bruno *  left the room (quit: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)).
107317 Enda *  entered the room.
107318 Tilda *  entered the room.
107321 Caron *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
107334 Margery :  Darlena: well, indulge me... I know a few things about computers.  I do know assembly
107339 Marcel *  entered the room.
107346 Darlena :  they have to jump through hoops every time to fit the newest extensions into the existing x86 architecture, because breaking backward compatibility is simply not a Good Idea
107353 Caron *  entered the room.
107354 Enda :  Is there any way at all to make it so Linux behaves like Windows in that it immediately syncs changes to disk and doesn't hurt anything when you just, for instance, yank a flash drive out with no warning beforehand whatsoever?
107385 Lakisha *  left the room (quit: "peace out").
107393 Darlena :  and the only way to add address lines - or any external connections - is to make the default run mode of the CPU identical to the reference platform - which every x86/x64 CPU  *still* is - it starts up in 8086 16-bit real mode
107395 Caron *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
107411 Sharlene :  Enda, I remember in Windows I yanked my flash drive out while I had a folder open...the folder disappeared the next time I put the flash drive in.
107432 Caron *  entered the room.
107439 Margery :  Enda: are you sure windows does this and linux does not? I would bet almost the opposite
107444 Enda :  Sharlene: Windows XP handles that gracefully. If you were using an earlier version that might do it.
107457 Sharlene :  Enda, I was using XP
107469 Natosha *  left the room (quit: ).
107476 Enda :  Margery: No, in Linux you must unmount the disk first. I'm trying to build a StepMania arcade cabinet in which users can save stats to a flash drive that might get knocked out, bumped, kicked, broken, yanked at random times...
107485 Angelika *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
107489 Enda :  Sharlene: You need to configure it for "quick unplugging" rather than "faster transfers"
107489 Lajuana *  is now known as Lajuana
107497 Enda :  Sharlene: assuming you're still using it
107508 Nan *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
107529 Lajuana :  Enda: windows does not remotely handle that gracefully and in fact you must unmount the disk first, it just doesn't call it unmounting, it calls it stopping.
107530 Margery :  faster tranfers... as in, "transfer to ram, do the hard work later" lol
107532 Sharlene :  Enda, oh I didn't know about that option.  I was using the Flash drive in a public library.  They must've had "faster transfers" on then.
107547 Sharlene :  predder, aahh good comment.
107553 Darlena :  Enda I wouldn't call it "graceful" in any situation.. Windows is bare-backed evil about your priceless hardware...
107565 Enda :  Sharlene: Yeah, most likely. Faster transfers is bad stuff...
107567 Alisa :  Darlena: why not just make a CPU architecture, 64-bit, that is incompatible with x86? Standardize it and make the software vendors recompile their shit for the new arch.
107571 Cleopatra *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
107571 Lajuana :  Unlike linux, it does try to sync things immediately rather than buffering it in memory - which is why it is so ass-slow - but neither does it guarantee that it writes everything in one go.
107588 Lajuana :  And Linux will actually write the stuff out in the background as fast as it can, usually.
107592 Darlena :  Alisa yes, why not indeed ? why don't you go first - sink a few billion into it, see how far you get :P
107593 Katie :  Enda a workaround for the arcade cabinet (assuming you control the code) might be to only mount the flash stick when you are actually using it
107598 Christa *  entered the room.
107602 Enda :  Lajuana: right... but I can at least say "Don't unplug this disk yet" - I don't care about their data if they don't heed the warning, I jsust care about the state of my machine
107604 Lajuana :  It's just that it'll buffer writes that can't keep up in memory rather than blocking the program for hours.
107606 Katie :  and keep it unmounted the rest of the time
107611 Sharlene :  Alisa, right now is the wrong time.
107617 Darlena :  Alisa designing and producing ONE new CPU costs billions of dollars
107626 Enda :  Katie: Hrm... I wasn't planning on hacking StepMania... but I might have to in this situation
107629 Margery :  Alisa: well, most software vendors won't do that.  Its better to introduce a backwards compatable system, even if it requires a few kluges
107636 Sharlene :  Alisa, Kind of like how Vista right now was a wrong time lol
107641 Malinda *  entered the room.
107643 Caron *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
107666 Caron *  entered the room.
107669 Malinda :  anyone know of decent web mail software that supports imap labels (e.g. tags in thunderbird)?
107670 Alisa :  Darlena: yeah, I know. Poorly formatted. 'why not just' is not a good prefix to a multi-billion dollar development. But that's besides the point, it would be possible for the industry to do it if there was incentive.
107673 Caron *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
107692 Lajuana :  Enda: anyways. Georgia mount option I think you're looking for is -osync
107710 Delia *  entered the room.
107717 Dagny :  MIPS Alpha, anyone? :)
107725 Darlena :  Alisa and that's always the crux - there is no incentive, ms is making billions off of vista right now, which is designed for the kludges built into the PC platform
107725 Jeanie *  entered the room.
107731 Jeanie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
107744 Enda :  Lajuana: Ah, thanks. Will that umount the drive when it's not physically present any more
107753 Darlena :  indeed, or even Sun Sparc - although they seem to have given up and now use powerpc or intel cpu's
107758 Fabiola *  entered the room.
107759 Margery :  honestly, there are some programs which will not be recompiled
107761 Lizeth :  vista is a joke
107766 Margery :  even linux programs
107768 Darlena :  a bad one, then
107769 Lajuana :  Enda: that I'm not sure about. All it guarantees is synchronous IO rather than buffering.
107788 Margery :  btw, does wine run 32 bit windows apps in 64 bit mode yet?
107796 Enda :  Lajuana: Well that is certainly an improvement over what I had before, that being nothing. I can most likely write a bash script to check dmesg for it being unplugged.
107797 Lajuana :  Enda: however, look into automount, or whatever it is that GNOME uses - it already does a lot of this stuff
107803 Lajuana :  Including deferred unmounts, etc.
107808 Darlena :  Enda basically, the OS *has* to flush every write to the drive before it can release it - and it can, of course, always go wrong if you yank it out too soon
107810 Lajuana :  So studying that may prove useful.
107817 Enda :  Okay, will do, Lajuana
107821 Riva *  entered the room.
107829 Enda :  Darlena: Right. but I don't care about the data if they yank it while my app says not to...
107837 Lajuana :  Margery: there are 64-bit builds of wine that emulate 32-bit windows.
107839 Sharlene :  Alisa, Darlena, now if a new CPU came out, it would have to be much faster than the current x86.  Kind of like why Apple decided "who cares about backward capabilities with PowerPC".  -- Apple knew that PowerPC was way faster than the current CPU product line.
107840 Enda :  that would be stupidity
107846 Darlena :  why don';t they just make BT USB drives instead ? nothing to unplug
107852 Enda :  hahaha
107858 Margery :  Lajuana: "emulate" or "provide a compatability layer"?
107859 Darlena :  yes, you laugh now
107860 Lajuana :  Margery: there are not, to my knowledge, any 64-bit builds that emulate 64-bit windows.
107862 Enda :  that's awesome... trouble is you'd have to mess with charging it...
107873 Lajuana :  Margery: for the purposes of this conversation, they are the same thing.
107879 Darlena :  well, you could always use USB for that....
107886 Claudie *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
107887 Enda :  true
107901 Lajuana :  Darlena: that's fine until they walk out of range halfway through a filesystem update
107911 Darlena :  which would be Their Problem
107916 Margery :  Lajuana: well, no, their not... theres speed differences amoung other things

107958 Marx *  entered the room.
107971 Lajuana :  Margery: however, wine only does one of them
107974 Enda :  Lajuana: They could do it like infrared comms... when you walk out of range the device complains and you can be like "shit shit" and run back over to the computer, and the transfer continue
107975 Harold *  entered the room.
107975 Avery *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
107976 Margery :  I thought PPC was less advanced than x86, various PC kluges not withstanding
107992 Lajuana :  So I am using "emulates" as a shorthand for "provides a compatibility wrapper around and loader for"
108016 Lajuana :  Because typing out the latter is a pain in the ass, and since the subject of conversation is wine, I thought it would completely obvious what I actually meant
108016 Margery :  fine
108016 Hallie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
108020 Darlena :  Margery it's true RISC, so no way is it "less advanced"
108024 Lajuana :  But apparently I was wrong!
108038 Hallie *  entered the room.
108040 Claretha *  entered the room.
108041 Celsa :  predder, yeah, its so obsolete that power5 line of ibm released some time ago is ppc... and plasytation 3
108050 Celsa :  erm, Margery
108054 Tisha *  entered the room.
108054 Lisha *  left the room (quit: "Off to fight the forces of stupidity").
108071 Celsa :  Darlena, just because its risk doesnt mean its more advanced, sigh
108077 Tisha :  if I make changes to my modules, is it necessary to run make modules before running make modules_install?
108078 Caron *  entered the room.
108079 Caron *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
108100 Katie :  afaict PPCs main problem was IBM couldn't get it both fast and cool
108105 Claretha :  This is where I go for Windows XP support, right?
108109 Claretha :  :P
108122 Margery :  I don't mean to be obsitnate, I just want to know... what makes risk better than cisc?  Has it been conculsively demonstrated that cisc arcutechture just can't work?
108129 Darlena :  Celsa it means that it doesn;t have to waste cycles decoding pseudo-ops, and it has very short pipelines
108134 Fabiola *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
108142 Celsa :  Katie, iirc the problem was with mobile chips... anyway, it wasnt entirely technical the criteria for changing to intel
108150 Bruno *  entered the room.
108152 Tisha :  eh....anyone?
108169 Darlena :  Margery different for different applications, obviously
108174 Nicki :  Margery: modern chips are somewhat of a mix of cisc and risc now
108179 Katie :  cisc only still works because intel put huge resources into making it still work ;)
108182 Darlena :  Margery for any realtime or near-realtime system, risc wins hands down
108184 Claretha :  Tisha: When you say "changes to my modules" what do you mean exactly?
108192 Celsa :  Margery, no, it hasnt.... if it was conclusevely demosntrated it cant work, nobody would be using it
108196 Sharlene :  Claretha, lol you can always ask a #windows question if you'd like :)
108209 Claretha :  Sharlene: Luckily for me, that was a joke ;)
108228 Margery :  Claretha: the solution to ever windows problem is power cycling
108234 Tisha :  Claretha: i mean when i add sata functionality
108242 Tisha :  select more modules
108256 Margery :  that why you should make sure to get a dependable power button with a windows computer
108265 Laurene :  Poll: what would YOU do when your boss (or coworker) would put up things like star trek / futurama quotes or images on work page (like - in change log)
108267 Alise :  A free software emulation of windows: OpenBSOD
108268 Celsa :  Margery, besides, there could be niche markets for it. So your generalizations are pretty silly
108312 Katie :  intel tried a more direct approach to instructions with itanium, it failed partly because of compatibilty issues and partly because it puts the chips performance at the mercy of compiler developers
108322 Claretha :  Tisha: Actually, I don't think you have to, but in the time it took for you to get an answer..you could've just typed make modules, and them make modules_install...couldn't you? :P
108346 Tisha :  Claretha: I did
108349 Tisha :  :P
108350 Claretha :  Tisha: I think make modules_install does the make modules part for you anyways.
108354 Margery :  Celsa: well, let me ask it this way... if I ran linux, and didn't run and windows programs, and I didn't need flash or adobe... what chipset would I be most interested in as a desktop user?
108358 Claretha :  Tisha: but I'm not positive.
108364 Tisha :  thx
108366 Tisha *  left the room.
108370 Sharlene :  Laurene, they must like star trek and futurama :) .  I wouldn't consider it wrong or bad.
108385 Claretha :  Margery: Oh no worries.  My computer auto power cycles itself randomly to make sure my windows is behaving... -_-
108412 Sharlene :  Laurene, ok actually I'd probably scream at them
108419 Margery :  Claretha: oh, so thats a feature... wow, windows is pretty well designed
108424 Laurene :  Sharlene: screem? :P
108439 Shameka *  entered the room.
108444 Celsa :  Margery, chipset?
108452 Claretha :  Laurene, Sharlene: Bah...it's nice having co-workers with a sense of humor.  Our changelogs at work are ALWAYS comical.  Keeps us from killing each other.
108460 Fabiola *  entered the room.
108468 Sharlene :  Claretha, Laurene, well that sounds so freakin' annoying!!  It's a distraction and totally stupid!  Argh!
108477 Claretha :  Margery: Actually, I'm 90% sure it's a hardware problem.  I've re-installed windows several times.  But that's another story.
108496 Margery :  Celsa: spark workstation, ppc, intel, amd, etc
108500 Claretha :  Sharlene: query: do you have a sense of humor? :)
108502 Concepcion *  entered the room.

108532 Sharlene :  Claretha, boolean(false)
108572 Margery :  Claretha: well, then your computer hardware is well designed, obviously.  You need to thank dell profusely

108637 Rachel :  Claretha: whats the name of the app, and is it text based or GUI?
108655 Jodee :  rpms can be installed by normal users, right?
108659 Vito *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
108659 Sharlene :  Sharlene, lol that doesn't make any sense.
108675 Leonarda :  Just a quick question for all of you linux users. I use linux because it is fast and reliable, it have everything I need in a computer and I can get work done faster. Why do you?
108682 Margery :  Jodee: not really...
108684 Rachel :  Margery: they'd crunch numbers faster and use less power.
108695 Rachel :  Leonarda: because i love windows
108701 Lizeth :  iuse linux to say fuck the man
108709 Celsa :  Margery, who know, the most recent generation are cells, niagara from sun... how would somebody know... its futurology
108710 Rachel :  %l Language please.  This is a family friendly channel. (supposed to be)
108719 Claretha :  Rachel: It's the licensing script from digium.  It's a compiled app that I can't modify.  It's console based.
108733 Margery :  !ohmy
108734 Rachel :  Claretha: and is it text based or GUI?
108742 Claretha :  Rachel: text based.
108745 Dagny *  left the room (quit: "Ex-Chat").
108746 Sharlene :  Margery, Celsa: the future of processors belongs to the super computers.  Just like how computers came out into the civilian world in the first place: military and research.  Just an idea.
108775 Margery :  My linux distro doesn't seem to be giving me the power and dependability that I want... I think I might reinstall
108778 Rachel :  Claretha:  only way i know to prevent users from using the menus is to front end it with an expect script.

108872 Margery :  should I be able to see kde redrawing windows when I switch between apps?  I'm on a dual core intel with an ati Mobility X1400 radeon
108881 Leonarda :  okay thanks guys. Now, is there any good way of managing directories etc, like I can set an expiration date? I make a lot of temporary directories to test programs I make, but I am lazy (I use linux)
108885 Rachel :  Claretha: well, the nice thing is that expect is very flexible, you can just put up a regex that matdhes all the invalid menu selections and respond with "cant do that sorry" and let the valid ones pass thru.
108898 Claretha :  Rachel: I tried just redirecting input from a file..and that kinda worked.  it makes it through the first couple of menus, but then it gets stuck in an endless loop of displaying the prompt for the next menu.
108919 Rachel :  Claretha: exactly why you need expect.
108928 Forrest *  entered the room.
108930 Rachel :  Claretha: Have you every used a modem style chat script?
108932 Krystina :  how do you change the name of your system, from say "tux" to "polarbear"
108940 Claretha :  Rachel: about 8 years ago :)
108953 Kaci *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
108961 Jodee :  Margery, what about debs?
108973 Krystina :  i know it's in some file, but i can't remember which one.
108991 Rachel :  Claretha: w/expect you tell it a regex of what to "expect" and it wont do anything until it gets a match, (or a timeout if you set that )
109019 Claretha :  Rachel: It looks like there's something called autoexpect that'll watch my session and record a script for me..ever used that?
109035 Emogene *  left the room (quit: ).
109037 Sharlene :  Leonarda, you could keep a small text file database.  [timestamp_of_expire] [filename]
109039 Nevada :  hyden as root hostname <desiredname>
109046 Rachel :  yes.  that can help quite a bit.  You'll need to modify it a little after its done.
109049 Nevada :  is that what you mean?
109076 Sharlene :  Leonarda, then have a CRON script analyze the textfile database and find which files have expired, and rm -fr $the_directory if it has.
109097 Leonarda :  Ah that is a great idea. Thanks!
109109 Jodee :  debs can be installed by normal users, right?
109138 Claretha :  Rachel: *sigh*  expect isn't installed on any of the boxes I want this on....crap
109139 Darlena :  wrong
109145 Jodee :  kk
109165 Krystina :  Nevada: that's it. Thanks :-)
109171 Sharlene :  Leonarda, To add to the text file database:  echo "`date +t` $nameOfFile" > text_file_db
109175 Krystina :  brb guys
109185 Krystina *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
109186 Margery :  Jodee: usually installing involves placing new files in system folders... linux just won't let non-sudo users to do that
109204 Arlie :  Adriana, hey
109217 Leonarda :  And then make an alias for ease of use (to make a directory) ?
109247 Jodee :  Margery, put them in ~/bin and use LD_LIBRARY_PATH?
109265 Margery :  Jodee: no clue
109301 Sharlene :  Leonarda, To remove a file:  `sed -i "s/^$nameOfFile .*//" text_file_db`  or something like that
109311 Jodee :  Margery, cheers anyhow
109316 Arlen *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
109318 Krystina *  entered the room.
109343 Rachel :  Leonarda: you could also just designate a test directory "X' and then once a day remove anything over N days old from it. (using cron)
109362 Margery :  hey what are you guy's uptime records?  I'm going on 9 days right now (laptop)
109378 Lakeshia *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
109403 Vito *  entered the room.
109404 Celsa :  Margery, uptime is a silly thing that leads you to an unsafe kernel...
109419 Margery :  Celsa: ?
109432 Rachel :  I hae an AT&T 3b1 running in a closet on the 4th floor of a building in NewJersey thats been up since 1989/
109436 Mirella *  entered the room.
109447 Margery :  Rachel:
109459 Rachel :  no one knows its there.
109466 Margery :  lol, linux wasn't invented till 1992... whats it running?  unix?
109477 Sharlene :  Rachel, Leonarda: I like that idea:  `stat -c '%Z' folderName` can give you the last modification of the directory.
109482 Berta *  entered the room.
109485 Rachel :  Margery: you have heard of AT&T right?
109506 Margery :  Rachel: I didn't realize they made an operating system
109515 Becki :  most people don't associate at&t with anything more than overpriced long-distance telephone service these days...
109532 Sharlene :  Margery, Bell Laboratory did a lot of OS research I believe.
109545 Rachel :  Margery: its called UNIX.
109547 Rochel :  do someone knows about vuze?
109587 Margery :  Celsa: what do you mean about uptime?  You saying that running linux for a long time makes it unstable?  Like, you know, a windows computer?
109587 Ching *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
109607 Celsa :  Margery, forget what Ive said
109609 Celsa :  brb
109614 Oliva *  left the room.
109635 Margery :  Rachel: lol, come to think of it, I should have know that.  I always liked that chart on wikipedia about all the unix dirivatives
109656 Rachel :  Margery: yes. You should have. :)
109666 Mack *  entered the room.
109685 Margery :  although, the chart didn't show windows on it?  wtf?  I mean, everyone knows that windows is based on the fast, stable unix platform
109709 Renetta *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
109710 Hellen *  waves the sacred trout of knowledge at Margery in a vaguely threating manner.... 
109715 Sharlene :  suuuure :)
109745 Renetta *  entered the room.
109750 Margery :  Is windows the only "modern" OS that doesn't have a unix base?
109753 Jesse :  Rachel: it's salmon, you dolt
109760 Arlie :  windows nt ... nigerian technology
109775 Fabiola *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
109784 Rachel :  Horacio: salmon is just a branch off the main trout release...
109788 Fabiola *  entered the room.
109797 Jesse :  isn't xp 'built on new technolgy technology'?
109798 Darlena :  Margery Nt was developed off principles the developer got from working on Digital's VMS
109801 Sharlene :  Salmon is version 2 of trout
109817 Rachel :  Trout 2.0
109820 Rachel :  :-)
109822 Darlena :  Margery so conceptually, they started with a POSIX-y base
109823 Arlie :  This is your last chance to save 20% on eBay Developers Conference.
109824 Jesse :  Rachel: nope, it's the salmon, no trouts involved
109834 Rachel :  sounds fishy to me.
109838 Darlena :  Margery though they managed to screw that up remarkably quickly
109841 Arlie :  You’ll also hear the future of eCommerce straight from eBay executives and other industry leaders, get inspired by content-rich business and technology sessions, and network with hundreds of entrepreneurs and developers just like you
109848 Hellen *  smackles Horacio with a trout
109859 Rachel :   ok, look. There is a trout involved!
109868 Darlena :  don't you mean "smackerels" ?
109877 Sharlene :  hurry someone!!
109882 Rachel :  oh clam up
109884 Grant *  slaps Darlena with salmon
109888 Laurene :  anyonbe remeber how to, in command line, overlay an image over another image
109890 Jesse :  Arlie: stop, the excitement is killing
109903 Darlena :  Laurene no, but you could try imagemagick

109917 Arlie :  Horacio, im telling you, i poo'd myself when i opened my inbox and saw that
109917 Rachel :  Horacio he did that on porpoise!

109963 Arlie :  thats better than a bj from a hooker in a parking lot
109965 Sharlene :  Margery, and then what happens after that?
109969 Laurene :  I see ppmcomp does it
109971 Darlena :  pretty soon I'm gonna snapper at someone
109975 Jesse :  Laurene: composite of imagemagick
109977 Rachel :  Arlie: I've about haddock with that !
109978 Margery :  Sharlene: reboot, and enjoy your aids"
109994 Laurene :  neat

110087 Rochel :  Laurene, ??
110097 Margery :  Laurene: did you know jared has aides?
110120 Laurene :  they helped him to get thin?
110135 Margery :  Laurene: there was a south park episode about that
110138 Margery :  it was funny
110139 Laurene :  yea
110140 Darlena :  Rochel if the internal host is on a static IP, make a static mapping (DNAT) in the PREROUTING chain
110146 Laurene :  NAMBLA was funny also
110150 Liliana *  has to go
110154 Laurene :  btw, the NAMBLA actually DO really exists O_o
110157 Darlena :  Rochel but also make sure return packets get routed back correctly
110180 Rochel :  Darlena, i know this, i was lookiing for help yesterday, but the routing i made hasnt work
110191 Arlie :  Laurene, its crazy isnt it
110195 Darlena :  Rochel paste you rrules

110215 Arlie :  nope ... free speech

110252 Rochel :  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 6879 -j DNAT --to 10.1.0.99:6879
110252 Arlie :  Laurene, that wouldnt surprise me ... catholic priests and nuns are messed up
110253 Adriana :  Laurene: probably a lie/joke but still wouldn't be surprise
110253 Izola *  entered the room.
110254 Yesenia :  Laurene: take it to #pedophiles
110262 Laurene :  Yesenia: no, thanks
110264 Arlie :  Adriana, your awake

110294 Laurene :  Merna: are you on crack
110304 Merna :  get get get get get get get ged not?
110305 Darlena :  Rochel I see no problems with that, unless your routing is screwed up - do you have the netmaks set properly for 10.1.0 ?
110307 Arlie :  Adriana, let me make some coffee, then i'll pvt msg you
110308 Yesenia :  Laurene: quit spreading misinformation. You don't know because you're not a ranking member of the catholic church, and neither is anyone you know, or know you know.
110312 Kandy *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
110314 Laurene :  !ops Merna is stoned and needs op attention
110317 Adriana :  ok good idea hm
110326 Rochel :  Darlena, sure
110332 Merna :  hmmmm
110335 Merna :  right
110341 Julie *  entered the room.
110347 Darlena :  Rochel then run wireshark or tcpdump on it and see what happens
110352 Laurene :  Yesenia: why the previous pope did nothing with the priest who WAS indeed pedophile
110359 Merna :  but what do i make here?
110363 Darlena :  telnet to that port from the iptables machine
110371 Laurene :  catcholic church is a totall failure and joke
110383 Merna :  why?
110385 Darlena :  if any packets make it through then the principle is sound, but they need to be routed back as well
110394 Yesenia :  Laurene: I'm not having this discussion first off, because it's about a subject that has NOTHING to do with linux, and secondly, because it's a subjective conversation with absolutely NO first-hand information
110429 Darlena :  and thirdly, you're a devout catholic who will hear nothing wrong about the institutions' pederasts ?
110430 Tonita :  heh, all religion is a joke.  we figured it out already.  the sun isn't some god, it's a burning mass of hydrogen.
110436 Sharlene :  Yesenia, Georgia first reason doesn't count, we go off topic all of the time here :]
110438 Lashon *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
110445 Laurene :  Yesenia: I know first-hand regular priests. They are often ass holes.  I know an catcholic priest who tells folowers to hate jews, for like 10 years now, and none pope did nothing to stop it.
110448 Rochel :  Darlena, i need to open the ports on iptable too, right?
110460 Darlena :  Rochel no idea what you mean by that
110477 Yesenia :  Laurene: So those 2 people represent the body of people as a whole in your world?
110482 Rochel :  Darlena, on the firewall
110487 Adriana :  Tonita: umm, yeah ok.  Think about buddahism no god yet is a religion.  Not all religion.
110488 Darlena :  Rochel what firewall ?
110489 Laurene :  Yesenia: the POPE did nothing to stop it
110490 Rochel :  Darlena, i need the ports opened too, right?
110492 Lashon *  entered the room.
110493 Jesse :  Rochel: you do not need to ACCEPT on the INPUT chain to forward ports
110500 Darlena :  Rochel you're repeating yourself
110504 Yesenia :  Laurene: Cite a single reference.
110506 Jesse :  Rochel: PREROUTING is enough
110512 Rochel :  ahh

110534 Ching *  entered the room.
110536 Rochel :  Darlena, what do tcpdump does?
110542 Laurene :  Yesenia: pope is aware about the priest who have in poland ~4 milion followers - because he tells followes to HATE JEWS. He does that for YEARS. And NONE POPE did anything with it! Google "radio maryja" or "rydzyk"
110543 Darlena :  exactly what it says
110552 Claretha :  Rachel: Hey, any ideas if it's possible to clear the screen with Expect even if you're in the middle of another script?  I guess I could try and use some ncurses routines or something, but I don't want the user's to even see the menu options.
110555 Jesse :  Yesenia: there are many - there was a vatican document circulated saying that any such cases should be dealt with internally, and the civil authorities should not be informed
110556 Eula *  left the room.
110571 Laurene :  Yesenia: you use linux - you are not an idiot, stop beeing catcholic lamerz.

110622 Laurene :  Yesenia: "No no that is a lie windows is NOT so bad, it is awesome!" <-- regular lamer, now s/windows/* god/g
110622 Merna :  right
110626 Delia *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").

110672 Arlie :  3) recipe for disaster
110678 Priscila :  no sex*
110680 Laurene :  Iraq/Iran idiots are also "no sex" / no pron
110690 Darlena :  ITYM "muslims"
110691 Jesse :  Arlie: plenty of grovelling, though...
110692 Arlie :  it makes them very angry and bitter ... nuns and priests that is
110694 Laurene :  actually, polish idiots want to put people in jail for distributing porn (norma porn)
110695 Merna :  i need no sex
110700 Yesenia :  Laurene: Your credibility sinks like a cliche cruise liner when you resort to ad homonym attacks
110702 Isaias *  entered the room.
110710 Laurene :  Yesenia: to what?
110716 Jesse :  Darlena: there is not so much difference between the 'abrahamic' religions
110717 Arlie :  at least, from the point of view of someone who went to a catholic school for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade
110729 Jesse :  Yesenia: 'ad hominem' ;(
110730 Nicki :  Yesenia: is 'add' and 'ad homonym'? ;)
110731 Jesse :  er, ;)

110788 Glenda *  believes in the flying speghetti monster
110788 Arlie :  Adriana, yeah, it used to be, its more of a business now tho
110797 Merna :  :D
110797 Adriana :  true.
110802 Esta *  believes everyone who believes in god needs professional counseling.
110818 Arlie :  the catholic church is guilty of killing people who didnt obey them
110819 Rachel :  Claretha: you can have expect run the app in a sub -process and interact seperatly with the user.  That will require you to send all the info/output to the user via the expect script
110824 Yesenia :  Laurene: I'm not trying to cause a debate. I'm simply stating that you should believe none of what you hear, and half of what you see.
110836 Darlena :  I used to believe in evolution but it let me down when I did not grow a longer penis in ties of need

110855 Rachel :  *severe
110867 Adriana :  but you can't dismiss religion based on the acts of humans.  You have to go search your own answers to this.

110877 Yesenia :  Honestly though, #linux. You guys are smart people, a conversation about how the catholic church is messed up is so simpleton.
110881 Rachel :  Arlie: don't forget about the torture before the killing.
110889 Arlie :  yeah, im not dismissing religion, just dismissing the catholic church ;)
110895 Sharlene :  Maybe the pope was the devil and he was trying to exploit the catholic religion!  It's all coming together now.
110895 Darlena :  Adriana why not ? religion *is* an "act of humans"
110896 Merna :  Adriana i cant read
110901 Rachel :  Horacio: Flying Spaghetti Monster of course!

110933 Lianne *  entered the room.
110934 Laurene :  Merna: how old are you
110936 Becki :  maybe religion is a form of mass-brainwashing, so everyone who believes it needs to be sent to deprogramming camp...
110938 Adriana :  Darlena: You can not say that for sure.  You weren't there when all the acts in the old testament and apocrypha aren't true.
110944 Arlie :  although, theres probably a market for dashboard jesus's that cry when you wet their feet with water ;)

110966 Yesenia :  Darlena: Well, you want to get technical about it. Everything humans have ever experienced has been through the senses of a human, and therefor everything ever is an act of a human.
110970 Darlena :  Adriana I can say that, because if there was proof, surely the religious institutions would have some
110973 Adriana :  Darlena: if you want to discuss the validity of them actually happening (with or without god's help) research more on biblical archeaology
110976 Merna :  right
110978 Yesenia :  the act of experiencing, the act of observing
110981 Rochel :  tnx
110982 Rochel :  Darlena, it is supposed to be alright, right? http://pastebin.ca/508441
110992 Merna :  ...
110994 Rochel :  Darlena, it is supposed to be alright, right? http://pastebin.ca/508441
111004 Nicki :  shhhh, a linux question
111016 Jesse :  Nicki: where? where?
111017 Anya :  is it possible to keep a user confined to his home directory without having to resort to a chroot? I have someone using ssh for irssi, but I don't want them roaming my system... and to keep my system as secure as possible
111030 Darlena :  Adriana I have no desire to engage in a subject that is so far from intellectually stimulating I don't even have words for what it is
111034 Becki :  biblical archeaology...  that's where someone strongly biased twists ambigious evidence to conform to his obesessive world-view, right?
111034 Talia *  entered the room.
111034 Nicki :  Horacio: well, iptables, :)
111037 Rachel :  Becki: it just old fashioned cultural indoctrination:  "Dont put your hands in the fire"  "Georgia world is flat." "God is watching you"
111041 Talia :  crud, this script just bombed out on me...
111047 Talia :  http://pastebin.linuxfromscratch.org/?show=3552
111066 Merna :  hmmmmmm
111070 Darlena :  Anya if all they use is irssi, set it up as his login shell
111073 Yesenia :  Darlena: Good stance. You should check out the american skeptic's society
111079 Talia :  I haven't been able to get an answer from lfs
111079 Arlie :  the world is round, peoples brains are flat
111091 Rachel :  Arlie: "fat"...
111096 Rochel :  Darlena, tnx man, it all worked
111104 Adriana :  Darlena: then don't get into it in the first place.
111107 Merna :  hmmmmm
111112 Anya :  Darlena: ah, well, screen + irssi... so...
111114 Darlena :  Yesenia I should what, and why ?  the fact that you're a religious bigot is becoming more and more inescapable - merely by the way you are so sure of yourself
111114 Yesenia :  So much misinformation, so many assumptions, so little rationality.
111126 Talia :  That script is to install sections of Xorg, like this one, the one that i'm suddenly getting problems on: http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/x7lib.html
111128 Kori *  goes looking for dental floss
111129 Bryon *  entered the room.
111130 Darlena :  indeed, starting with you
111138 Rochel :  who was the man who helped me yesterday to open the port 6879??
111140 Rachel :  Claretha: you may want to look at the kibitz script example to see some tricker expect stuff
111157 Jesse :  Arlie: you (and others) might find this of interest: http://fstdt.com/top100.asp
111158 Darlena :  Adriana I'm being drawn in against my will.. I need to be de-brainwashed
111166 Stevie *  left the room (quit: ).
111168 Yesenia :  Darlena: I'm not religious at all. Georgia american skeptic's society is a society of people who completely write off religion as nearly a sickness.
111172 Jesse :  Arlie: talking of flat brains ;)
111179 Adriana :  Darlena: grow a spine, it's all will power
111182 Merna :  dam dam dam dum
111184 Arlie :  Horacio, whats FSTDT ?
111191 Darlena :  Adriana my spine is one of my weaker points
111195 Arlie :  Horacio, nm
111197 Yesenia :  Darlena: It's a society of critical, rational thinkers who dispel misinformation in science, and news.
111199 Adriana :  Darlena: I can tell
111200 Talia :  Do any of you have any idea of what I can do? All the people in #lfs-support on irc.linuxfromscratch.org are idle
111213 Awilda *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
111215 Lorilee *  entered the room.
111215 Darlena :  Yesenia well, religious nut or not, you're preaching
111231 Lorilee *  is now known as Lorilee
111240 Yesenia :  Darlena: Right. Whatever, noob.
111243 Rachel :  <Yesenia> .... so little rationality.  << indeed. irrationality is the foundation of all revalatory religions
111247 Arlie :  "Georgia more Marylin, the heavier something is."
111252 Merna :  hmmmmm
111253 Darlena :  heh, I never get tired of that
111254 Jesse :  Arlie: it's obvious
111269 Tonita :  Talia: get a real distro?
111274 Bryon :  hahaha
111276 Rochel :  well, i really dont know, so, tnx all
111276 Rochel :  :D
111276 Maurita *  gone
111279 Lessie *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
111280 Beula *  prefers to tan
111283 Arlie :  sure ... i knew einstein was a satan worshipper ... noone would listen tho
111292 Talia :  Tonita: this is a real distro, you build your own
111299 Jesse :  "I appreciate your recommendation, and it is intriguing, but as a pro-lifer, I cannot support an organization that is opposed to the death penalty."
111305 Clifford *  entered the room.
111308 Darlena :  ..which would make it both less and more than a "distro" :)
111314 Prince *  left the room (quit: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)).
111315 Yesenia :  "How dare thee introduce me to something new! How dare thee type into mine IRC! Mine self righteousness will never allow the sharing of ideas into my heavily fortified learning centers!"
111321 Darlena :  Horacio quoting who ?
111324 Kathleen *  entered the room.
111325 Adriana :  is it really that bad to worship satan, I mean historically (before the RCC destroyed it) he isn't evil, he just wanted humans to be human.
111325 Arlie :  "Evolution says that we started out simple, and over time became more complex. That just isn't possible: UNLESS there is a giant outside source of energy supplying the Earth with huge amounts of energy. If there were such a source, scientists would certainly know about it."
111331 Merna :  sailing
111335 Merna :  stars
111338 Rachel :  Yesenia: Are you describing religous fundamentalists?
111344 Jesse :  Darlena: bar Jonah, Theology Web [Comments (71)] [2006-Jan-20], apparently
111346 Darlena :  Arlie that is priceless :)
111358 Talia :  ...
111360 Talia :  Anybody?
111365 Arlie :  Adriana, it was intended as a logic error .. not a religious choice issue ;)
111366 Nilsa *  left the room (quit: "A cow. A trampoline. Together, they fight crime.").
111369 Jesse :  Arlie: mind-blowing, eh?
111373 Talia :  I'm trying to compile Xorg 7.1
111374 Adrien *  snickers at hm
111381 Kori *  gives monkey 3 lashes for not footnote'ing
111382 Arlie :  Horacio, truly ;)
111391 Nicki :  "I want a satanic funeral." "BOOOO!"
111395 Tonita :  Talia: seriously man.  I mean, lfs is pointless.  what do you hope to accomplish with it?  super customized?  I can do that with redhat.  optimized because I compiled everything from source?  I can do that with debian.  but it's not going to be nearly the pain in the ass lfs is
111399 Darlena :  Talia the LFS manula is supposed to get you there all the way, for a given value of "manual"
111405 Bryon :  can you explain the following line ? "I have sinned! the crawling! the falling down!"
111410 Yesenia :  Rachel: I was describing anyone who would discredit someone by telling them that they are preaching. Anyone who would make up their mind about information before they critically analyze it.
111421 Talia :  bah
111423 Darlena :  of course not, who ever thinks like that ?
111433 Jesse :  "Me and my husband is thinking about having a baby, but hestitate, because his brother (which we have no contact with whatsoever) is presumably gay. Might this affect the baby? Is there some precautions I can take, or some medicaments I can eat to make sure my child is pure? Thank you for your help, don't know what i'll do without you"
111436 Lianne :  He could be using lfs to learn system development cycle
111448 Tonita :  Talia: or what, you're just trying to learn more things linux?  I spose...but there's a better way to go about it in my opinion.
111449 Talia :  I just want help, not a arguing contest
111455 Bryon :  is he crawling because he's sinning, or crawling because he's penitent?
111455 Yesenia :  Horacio: that's a sad quote.
111457 Talia :  Tonita: yes
111462 Arlie :  "[about a girl being born with mental disabilities] Most afflictions like this are caused by sins committed while still inside the womb."
111466 Jesse :  Yesenia: scarey, huh?
111472 Yesenia :  Horacio: Is that real?
111482 Bryon :  Arlie: I can't believe someone would say that
111484 Darlena :  Horacio I can recommend some "medicaments" she can eat, yeah.. fscking religious breeders should all be forbidden more than 1/2 child
111486 Francina *  left the room (quit: "Error in quit message").
111493 Rosita *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
111503 Arlie :  Bryon, ah ... but they did ;)
111504 Rachel :  Yesenia: I'm afraid that saying "God is real because I believe in him or, Georgia bible says so." isn't actually information.
111505 Tonita :  Talia: probably help to actually tell us what the problem is then
111516 Jesse :  Yesenia: it appears to be
111519 Rachel :  Yesenia: so yes. Thats preaching
111530 Merna :  the biible mistakes its own
111538 Jesse :  "If we did evolve from monkeys then how come babies arent born monkeys"
111544 Yesenia :  Rachel: it's information, just not true information to anyone who would ever rationally put it to the test.
111545 Arlie :  "There are a lot of things I have concluded to be wrong, without studying them in-depth. Evolution is one of them. Georgia fact that I don't know that much about it does not bother me in the least."
111546 Prince *  entered the room.
111548 Nicki :  what is so difficult about having religious discussions in #religion and linux discussion here?
111566 Becki :  what compels people to treat some random work of fiction as a holy book, anyway?
111566 Lianne :  Jana the taliban will get them in there
111567 Nicki :   you guys need help with the /join command? ;)
111570 Yesenia :  Nicki: Because in #religion we can't piss off purists like you
111574 Jesse :  "
111576 Jesse :  I believe Adam spoke english, God spoke english, and everyone's language was confused at the Tower of Bable. Only when God's complete revelation comes to man do we come back to his holy language again."
111581 Arlie :  Becki, its not a random work of fiction
111601 Mirella *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
111606 Darlena :  "I once wrote a short story about Gnuugh, a rogue Neanderthal with extraordinary powers of smell... I wroted it down myself, and looked at it later, so He must be Real, and I will make Him my god"
111608 Lianne :  english? haha
111611 Nicki :  Yesenia: wow, you are quite the troll. I haven't even been involved in this "dicussion" you have been provoking the last 20 minues *after* you said yourself it was offtopic and you weren't going to argue
111616 Lianne :  that shitty language, hope not
111618 Arlie :  Becki, its a book, written by acient people, with lots of very valueable info, still applicable to todays world .... the hocus pocus shit in it tho is just that, hocus pocus
111618 Jesse :  Becki: much of it is highly self-serving mythology
111623 Arlie :  er..ancient
111628 Tonita :  Talia: ha, guess I missed your pastebin thingy in all the excitement.  fair enough
111657 Arlie :  "I appreciate your recommendation, and it is intriguing, but as a pro-lifer, I cannot support an organization that is opposed to the death penalty."
111660 Darlena :  Nicki  what is difficult is that religious nuts cannot and will not understand that not everything is connected to religion
111661 Tilda *  left the room (quit: "Lost terminal").
111664 Gladis :  Nicki: you learn how this channel is very quickly. So hush. If you don't want to hear it, then don't hang in here. No one is forcing you to be here.
111677 Bryon :  um... arent there religious people who aren't nuts?
111683 Yesenia :  Nicki: You're right. I shouldn't be having stupid conversations with idiots. I'll see you later.
111685 Jesse :  "What part of I know that the bible is true because the bible tells me that it is true do you have trouble understanding?
111687 Darlena :  not to my knowledge
111688 Jesse :  Don't you feel silly disagreeing with such a logical argument?
111691 Jesse :  Love and blessings Don"
111691 Andria :  What the Hell is going on?
111698 Yang :  "I like your Christ, but i do not like your Christians" --Ghandi
111714 Oretha :  Oh yeah, oh yeah, I just got myself a new lappie
111714 Arlie :  "[Am I in discussion with a human who has a functioning brain?]
111714 Arlie :  What does a functioning brain have to do with the Bible?"
111716 Darlena :  "Buggrit!"
111720 Talia :  My problem is that I can't compile the rest of this section, "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/x7lib.html", the script just bombs out suddenly, right after fully installing a certain package (not sure which)
111721 Lianne :  Logical? yours, i havent heard more childish ramble in years
111722 Becki :  Bryon:  of course not.
111724 Tonita :  Talia: you're missing some library that libxfont expects to be there.
111729 Jesse :  Arlie: many a gem ;)
111735 Nicki :  Gladis: I don't have to abandon our channel to the trolls.  and I am perfectly within my rights to complain to them for provoking offtopic conversations.  "love it or leave it" is a moronic philosophy
111735 Rochel *  left the room ("work to do... [http://www.portalsi.info][http://www.the.blog.br/samuraidio]").
111736 Talia :  Huh?
111740 Talia :  Which one?
111745 Arlie :  ""Make sure your answer uses Scripture, not logic.""
111758 Oretha :  Did I happan to drop in here in the middle of a theological feud of some sort
111760 Talia :  I deleted some tarballs intentionally
111766 Tonita :  Talia: whatever has the headers with TT_Face and so forth defined in it
111772 Rachel :  Andria: its out 7 times daily religous discussion :-)
111776 Bryon :  gods wife left him
111778 Jesse :  Oretha: no, we're just enjoying http://fstdt.com/top100.asp
111778 Yesenia :  Nicki: How about, "Don't be the jerkass who thinks he's so important that he can say what a room of people can, and can't speak about."
111778 Bruno :  Hm, I love the smell of flamefest in the morning...
111779 Rachel :  S/out/our
111785 Gladis :  Nicki: Just saying your complaining will accomplish absolutely nothing.
111785 Arlie :  "several million years for a monkey to turn into a man. oh wait thats right. monkeys dont live several million years."
111789 Andria :  Wonderful.
111789 Bryon *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
111792 Jesse :  teehee
111797 Darlena :  I propose a new type of Turing Test - the Lazarus Litmus.. to detect whether somebody is a religious nut without actually being forced to listen to him
111797 Lianne :  Why are you typing in quotes?
111807 Andria :  I dunno.
111809 Rachel :  "who? me?"
111816 Arlie :  damn !
111823 Arlie :  some dude is pointing a gun at my head !
111823 Yesenia :  Nicki: Anyways, I'm sorry for bothering you. I shouldn't have got involved with someone so irrelevant in the first place.
111825 Andria :  Religion just makes me think we should all be upgraded by the CyberMen.
111829 Angie *  points accusingly at the American gov'mint
111830 Nicki :  Gladis: if people think noone cares the trolls *will* stay here and try to take over.
111837 Yesenia :  I'm outs, guys. Take care.
111844 Philip *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
111844 Rachel :  cya
111845 Oretha :  What's FSTDT?
111856 Jesse :  Arlie: "I didn't come to Jesus by my intelligence and neither will you my friend."
111867 Yesenia :  Nicki: Just for you, I think I'm going to stick around this channel a lot in the future.
111868 Arlie :  Horacio, amen brother
111875 Darlena :  let's all be thankful that he did not need his intelligence to find Jesus
111882 Darlena :  scratch "his"
111885 Arlie :  "If u have sex before marriage then in Gods eyes u are married to that person if a man rapes a woman in Gods eyes they are married it sucks for the girl but what can we do lol"
111913 Sharlene :  Nicki, Yesenia aahh such friendship lol
111913 Lianne :  are you quoting from someone?
111920 Hildegard :  probably himself.
111921 Hildegard :  :P
111925 Jesse :  First it's evolution. Then comes plate tectonics and the Big-Bang. Then comes Athiesm.
111931 Darlena :  we should have Religious Death Match on TV - Amazons vs Christians, Buddhists vs Muslims, all sorts of fun would ensue
111940 Rachel :  Horacio: we need a web page with a long list of all the things people used to get indoctrinated with but don't beleive anymore (cause we "modern" humans are much smarter than our ancestors who had exactly the same genetic make up as we do.)
111941 Arlie :  Lianne, me ?
111942 Tonita :  Talia: ha, or maybe you just have a typo in one of those include directives it's talking about.  I'd have a look at that .c file
111942 Sharlene :  Nicki, Yesenia Whatever happened to "Love thy neighbor?"
111946 Yesenia :  Sharlene: forgive me. I'm one of those unfortunates who can't help but try and get the last word =)
111946 Nicki :  what an idiot, he forgot who was arguing with for the last half hour.  I wasn't talking to him at all until he address me a couple minutes ago
111947 Oretha :  That reminds me that I recently ordered a fancy copy of "the flying spaghetti monster" from ebay
111948 Lianne :  Jana that someone is really confused, and is not worth quoting from, unless you are doing it for a laugh
111950 Arlie :  Lianne, some page with wacked out quotes o it
111953 Rachel :  Darlena: we have that.
111957 Lianne :  oh cool
111958 Arlie :  Lianne, http://fstdt.com/top100.asp
111961 Gladis :  Nicki: I have been in this channel for months. I don't mind their talk, it does not remotely bother me, most of it IS indeed offensive, but it is what they think. I get help here most the time no problem, and they talk about whatever they talk about no problem. Have no idea how long you have been in this channel, but it is how it is.
111961 Rachel :  Darlena: its on the news every night
111963 Oretha :  err "the flying spaghetti monster gospel"
111969 Darlena :  Rachel oh yeah, I forgot - it's CNN, isn't it ?
111970 Jesse :  Darlena: what's wrong with the good old 'christians v. lions' ?
111975 Rachel :  Darlena: Yup :-)
111978 Patrick *  left the room (quit: SendQ exceeded).
111981 Tonita :  Talia: ha, actually, I'd just get a real distro.  you can go through all this pain and have X running at the same time if you really want.
111982 Elaine *  entered the room.
111982 Talia :  libXfont-1.1.0.tar.bz2 -- remove it, if I don't, the script will recompile it without a patch
111982 Talia :  xtrans-1.0.3.tar.bz2 , libfontenc-1.0.4.tar.bz2 -- already installed them
111983 Rachel :  Horacio: we ckilled most of the lions...
111989 Arlie :  "homosexual activity is up to three times deadlier than smoking."
111994 Rachel :  Horacio: hey... that could work...
111994 Darlena :  Horacio I think it's mental torture to the lions, they should quit that shit
111997 Nicki :  Gladis: non of the other channels on freenode aer this bad, though (except for #politics)  it can be a *lot* better and more useful resource for linux folks
112020 Rachel :  Nicki We always give the linux questions priority.
112032 Patrick *  entered the room.
112037 Darlena :  unless they're to do with religion, of course
112063 Darlena :  "Is Linux really Free, or is it enslaved by the Philistines?"
112068 Tonita :  Arlie: who you quoting?  Jerry Fallwell?
112071 Gia *  entered the room.
112076 Jesse :  Gladis: most of the talk of the channel is offensive to you?
112079 Darlena :  I vote for Tipper
112084 Arlie :  Tonita, random insane people
112101 Rachel :  OK CHANNEL- BREAK for LINUX QUESTIONS:
112109 Rachel :  Any one  with a question?
112110 Arlie :  "Robert Hale, a Bible-toting father of 15 who calls himself Papa Pilgrim, became an anti-government celebrity in Alaska by driving a bulldozer across a national park that encircles his land. He said his children read only the Bible, always bathed with their clothes on and were not allowed to see one another naked. He pleaded no contest to multiple charges that he raped one of his daughters"
112115 Tonita :  Rachel: what's the best linux distro?
112119 Riva *  left the room (quit: ).
112124 Angila *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
112132 Rachel :  Tonita: Thats a religous question. :-)
112135 Tonita :  Rachel: and should I use gnome or kde?
112137 Sharlene :  Rachel, Don't answer! lol
112138 Angila *  entered the room.
112138 Bruno :  Rachel: sure... how to fix acpi support on my asus laptop?
112144 Rachel :  so that
112145 Sharlene :  haha!
112148 Mirella *  entered the room.
112152 Rachel :  Bruno: prayer my son!
112156 Jesse :  Bruno: what's wrong with it?
112161 Gladis :  Horacio: well, there is offensive talk that most would find offensive, but to me personally I am not offended in the least. I respect people for what they believe and I know I don't have to agree or disagree.
112186 Angila *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
112189 Lizeth :  me also distro wars caused me to use alot of good linux distros
112191 Rubye *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
112191 Bruno :  Horacio: no bat or fans recognized. suspend works, cpu profiles seem to too. lcd brightness and other asus extensions don't.
112204 Jesse :  Gladis: what makes you think 'most' would find it offensive, if you don't? are you so much more 'free thinking' than most?
112211 Darlena :  cluebat not recognised ? that's bad
112221 Jesse :  Bruno: google knows nothing?
112223 Rachel :  Bruno: sounds liek a it needs some specific MB driver code fro mASUS?
112226 Rachel :  *like
112234 Darlena :  freethinking is a very popular self-deception
112238 Kori *  is going to Rachel from Andria with the help of wolferine and Becki by summoning the spirit of the Arlie and by repeatedly stabbing it with his Oretha . Mellisa the Andria will return to the land of the Lizeth for more Horacio juice and Darlena blood
112240 Bruno :  Horacio: nothing concrete. and i don't really know what to look for.
112245 Nicki :  well, this might help someone, else. :) I had a weird issue with azureus sporadically getting timeouts and stopping downloads/uplaods.  it turned out that I was hitting /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_max  (on my debian etch firewall) bumped it up and my woes went away.
112254 Bruno :  Rachel: MB?
112254 Rachel :  heh IRCnick fiction...
112260 Rachel :  Bruno: mainboard
112261 Lizeth *  left the room.
112261 Jesse :  Bruno: you could decompile your dsdt, and recompile it, and see if there are errors, and if so, try to fix them
112261 Talia :  WTF?
112263 Arlie :  Lianne, your gonna stab me spirit ? you bastard !
112266 Tobi *  entered the room.
112274 Angila *  entered the room.
112275 Rachel :  Talia: IRCnick fiction...
112279 Sharlene :  Arlie, That Christian was a brain-washed one.  I mean if we draw a pie chart of all of the Christians, there's going to be a decent % that do wrong.  If we a draw a pie chart of the buddhists, I'm sure it will look the same way.  Like someone has already said: human actions do not conclude whether or not certain ideas (i.e. religious ideas) are boolean false, or boolean true.
112283 Talia :  A script that is just the same script recreated works...
112291 Bruno :  Rachel: ah. yea, well... probably. but thatshit scares me :P
112298 Rachel :  me tto.
112300 Rachel :  too
112303 Talia :  same one that Tonita looked at
112311 Gladis :  Horacio: I live in texas surrounded by right wing liberal christians. I am used to being around these nuts so most of them would be quite offended...I will be happy when I can move.
112316 Jesse :  Bruno: you checked out linux-laptop.net and/or tuxmobil.org for known issues with your model?
112322 Bruno :  Horacio: tried that the other day, there are several warnings (like "unreachable statement")
112328 Jesse :  Gladis: ok, I take your point ;)
112335 Darlena :  Gladis better watch out for the hoodies at night...:)
112335 Talia :  Wait...maybe I had "../lib-7.1.wget" screwed up
112339 Gladis :  Horacio: sorry I mean right wing conservative christian
112353 Nicki :  Gladis: heh, I was wondering about that, :)
112353 Tonita :  Sharlene: nah.  you need to read that book that just came out on the very same subject.  letter to god or whatever the heck.  sorry I can't remember the name
112356 Bruno :  Horacio: but i have no clue how to fix them.
112358 Jesse :  Gladis: I read that ;)
112359 Talia :  It contains a list of files to download with wget, and it's used by the script to find out which files to extract
112359 Mirella *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
112378 Talia :  I think I messed up on creating that .wget file
112381 Darlena :  "right wing liberal " just doesn;t parse, so no worries
112384 Talia :  I had to delete 3 things from it
112394 Tonita :  Sharlene: anyhow, the jist is, even if you're a good christian or whatever the heck, by abandoning reason and going with faith, you pave the way for nutjobs.
112406 Jesse :  Bruno: nor I - does googling the warnings in whole or part turn up anything of interest? it may well be that someone has a fixed dsdt somewhere aready
112418 Tonita :  Sharlene: a standpoint I holdheartedly agree with
112423 Forrest :  hehe, religion.  funny stuff.  you guys would probably enjoy this: http://www.cracked.com/index.php?name=News&sid=1649&pageid=5
112425 Gladis :  Horacio: ^__^ yeah, people are just a bit scary here sometimes. thankfully I managed to find friends who are not as close minded.
112425 Rachel :  Darlena: oh great, now I'm stuck on trying to figure out how to create a right wing liberal.....
112428 Darlena :  Tonita and that's the jism ? or did you really mean "gist" ?
112429 Forrest :  caution bad words
112431 Arlie :  Sharlene, that was a deep thought ... i dont believe in right or wrong ... so my chart is gonna be empty
112447 Tonita :  Darlena: so I can't spell.  relax chief
112467 Kori *  is a kgosi
112470 Gladis :  Horacio: actually it seems the majority of my friends are gay/lesbian. well, I am off to see POC 3. night!
112479 Jesse :  Gladis: satanist!
112480 Julie :  Q: how many kBytes in 1 gigabit? (setting up the xfce network load tray plugin)

112498 Oretha :  Have a look at the third quote
112500 Rachel :  Gladis: have some popcorn for me!
112501 Bruno :  Horacio: hm, i just found a page that looks promising: http://gquintana.free.fr/laptop/asus_f3jc/kubuntu-6.10.html
112508 Oretha :  Err.... the sun?
112514 Gladis :  Horacio: lol. have a satanist friend in montana actually...he is disturbing.
112514 Bruno :  Horacio: will look at it tomorrow, 3am here. thanks for the pointers.
112517 Gladis :  Rachel: I shall!
112521 Rachel :  :-)
112524 Gladis *  left the room (quit: "ChatZilla 0.9.78.1 [Firefox 2.0.0.3/2007040314]").
112525 Francisco :  is there a place to put a bash command i want to only be executed once when my computer starts up?
112528 Jesse :  Oretha: shhh...
112531 Darlena :  Tonita that's 50 % right there.. now you have me worrying over your nick
112533 Lianne :  woops, ma bad, thats *bvtes to *bytes
112540 Arlie :  what would we do without public education
112541 Nicki :  Francisco: which distro?
112548 Francisco :  Nicki: suse 10.2
112548 Darlena :  Forrest that sh*t is WHACK ! un-be-lievable
112556 Forrest :  :D
112564 Rachel :  Francisco: rc.local
112570 Darlena :  Forrest he looks like a snake, or a reptile, anyways... with that head
112582 Nicki :  Francisco: /etc/rc.d/rc.local I think
112584 Darlena :  heh snake.. brings up memories of Eden :)
112593 Krystina :  has anyone else found yast's installation of any file to be excrutiatingly long!
112594 Lianne :  Alise_, 131072
112605 Darlena :  by their own insane troll logic, that would be proof that he is evil
112609 Krystina :  as opposed to say gentoo portage or debian's apt.
112617 Layla *  left the room (quit: "?I-n-v-i-s-i-o-n? 2.0 Build 3515").

112635 Sharlene :  Arlie, what would people in Uganda do without public education?
112647 Forrest :  "the devil is a MFing liar, so I ain't worried... BEYOTCH"
112650 Arlie :  Sharlene, hard to say, they bathe in poo now
112659 Sharlene :  lol
112662 Mitzie *  left the room (quit: Connection reset by Brandie).
112666 Mitzie *  entered the room.
112679 Sharlene :  I think more and more are bathing in water.
112689 Arlie :  poo water
112717 Sharlene :  Georgia ratio of poo and water is decreasing.
112724 Arlie :  thats a plus
112749 Danette *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
112757 Arlie :  anyway, that was as unfair a jab at uganda as you claiming they are all ignorant ... i really dont know much about uganda
112760 Sharlene :  I don't know...I think you and I should visit there someday and take some samples lol
112770 Danette *  entered the room.
112787 Boris :  is it possible to serve up regular web pages on the same machine that is running mongrel_rails?
112790 Sandy *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
112803 Sharlene :  Arlie, I was not claiming that
112818 Lianne :  who's from uganada?
112825 Sandy *  entered the room.
112833 Boris :  the reason is i wanna serve up templates
112834 Oretha :  "We should burn the gays at the stake, it worked in the Inquisition...I don't see any witches around anymore"
112835 Arlie :  Sharlene, well ... when you thought of no education .. you thought of uganda ... and your correct, you didnt make an actual claim, but you understand my point
112836 Oretha :  That's just lovely
112838 Boris :  for use in layours
112889 Arlie :  Sharlene, in any case, it was just a joke ;)
112900 Shira :  hehe Europe without public education would be like the US is right now :0p
112928 Mack *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
112930 Arlie :  don't start bashing the US ... we have enough problems
112936 Sharlene :  Oh man I am such a hard case and ass hat today...I think I need some Ovaltine and a jog.
112945 Mack *  entered the room.
112951 Shira :  Arlie: wasent bashing, was just being realistic
112967 Arlie :  yes, europeans are so smart
112974 Lianne :  Sharlene possumness3
113016 Lianne :  Shira, Americans cant help being retarded, its just the system, they arent naturally retarded
113026 Sunni *  entered the room.
113044 Shira :  Lianne: are you sure, Jana they could easly fool me :)
113051 Arlie :  i seriously doubt, that the average american, is any more or less intelligent than the average person from any place else
113091 Carissa *  left the room (quit: Read error: 113 (No route to host)).
113107 Arlie :  but at the moment, europeans are finding some sort of satisfaction in bashing americans ... for whatever reason ... so just because they want to, makes it true and okay
113119 Lianne :  Georgia average American probably has an IQ below 70
113129 Julietta *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
113135 Lianne :  (and if you are one of those people, it means your RETARDED)
113140 Qiana *  entered the room.
113143 Qiana :  howdy linux folk,
113162 Qiana :  For systems with greater than 4G of RAM.. does one need to head the direction of 64-bit kernel/apps?
113171 Leonarda :  No
113173 Son *  left the room (quit: "Success!").
113178 Lianne :  No
113192 Arlie :  now, being an american, i think i should start saying that all dutch people are drug and sex addicts, germans are all nazis, the french are dick suckers, and the english are stuck up snobs .... and if i did that, it would somehow be proof im a stupid american
113196 Qiana :  Would it be wise to look that direction for a dedicated psql server?
113213 Arlie :  even tho, its the same action as saying all americans are stupid
113214 Qiana :  hm.. looks like I've stepped into a godwin situation.
113216 Leonarda :  However, running all applications for linux at the same time will only use 2GB of RAM at most, so it is pointless to have 4GB
113226 Ling *  left the room (quit: "restarting to put new code in use").
113230 Lianne :  There might be truth in what you say, but Americans are the cream of the cake in being retarded
113237 Tonita :  Arlie: ha, I just go with most people in general are stupid.
113240 Ling *  entered the room.
113256 Jesse :  Qiana: we haven't had Ashcroft's Corollary yet ;)
113257 Arlie :  Tonita, yes ... and when you have an above average iq, thats the world you live in
113265 Qiana :  :)
113269 Lianne :  Leonarda, you have no idea how quick 2gb of memory gets used up
113292 Krystina *  left the room (quit: "Konversation terminated!").
113293 Tonita :  Lianne: nah, just human nature.  they have money and whatnot so they need to get shiney things and get fat and whatnot.  would happen to anyone in any country in a similar situation
113301 Qiana :  Leonarda,  wasn't that limitation lifted with 2.6?
113315 Tonita :  Darlena: fine, shiny
113315 Daysi *  entered the room.
113315 Arlie :  i get to watch my countries government make mistake after mistake, and be called stupid for it by europeans who are looking for someone to hate this week, its a real joy
113323 Tonita :  Darlena: happy?
113341 Katie :  Leonarda, more memory means larger datasets can be kept in ram at once
113346 Son *  entered the room.
113350 Lianne :  Tonita, very true, i blame the Educational System and the lack of proper parental guidance
113352 Katie :  one app can easilly eat several gigs of ram
113364 Talia :  i'm an American
113374 Tonita :  Talia: then you're fired
113377 Lianne :  haha
113380 Talia :  haha
113390 Lianne :  Reality TV baby, dont you love it

113416 Mack *  entered the room.
113451 Lourdes *  entered the room.
113464 Lourdes :  Hi, anybody knows a good GUI/graphical text editor that can find & replace multiline text? kinda like EditPad Pro... I know kate/gedit/geany can find & replace but only one line, I need to find & replace multiple lines together. Anybody knows?
113467 Jesse :  Arlie: they hate your freedoms ;)
113484 Arlie :  Horacio, im a slave to money same as they are
113484 Colene :  wireshark is still compiling geesh.
113495 Qiana :  DARKGirl,  49% will tell you vi, 49% will tell you emacs.
113505 Jesse :  Colene: why are you compiling it?
113515 Arlie :  Horacio, im just not all caught up in what the newspaper, the tv, and other people are claiming to be truth
113516 Jesse :  Qiana: ESEX
113524 Lourdes :  Qiana: and I know 0% of those, neither they're GUI-like
113525 Ellena *  entered the room.
113525 Claretha :  Rachel: Hey, thanks a lot for that.  Expect did the job beautifully.  To hide the first part of the menu's from the users, I used 'log_user 0' to turn off the output.  When I'm ready to give functionality back to the user, I just set 'log_user 1'.
113528 Gia :  yep wireshark has a ton of plugins and each needs compiled
113530 Colene :  using emerge on gentoo..
113536 Justa *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
113548 Jesse :  Colene: hahaha - no one but yourself to blame then
113553 Lianne :  why did they rename ethereal to wireshank?
113554 Qiana :  vim-gtk and emacs-x11 :)
113565 Gia :  Lianne: fork / dev disagreements
113581 Colene :  sigh
113581 Gia :  Colene: anyway it took 16 minutes on my 1.9GHz pentium M
113586 Lianne :  Lourdes, i suggest you write a bash script to do find and replace using vim
113587 Lourdes :  Qiana: they both require reading a 30-page-manual just for doing a simple task... isn't there an easier way?
113597 Colene :  well it must be the plugins..  i see alot of errors too
113599 Jesse :  Arlie: I'm not a fan of 'broadcast' media
113611 Colene :  like packet-parlay.c:85819: warning: 'decode_org_csapi_fw_TpLoadInitVal_st' defined but not used
113613 Qiana :  DARKGirl,  I'm sure there is.  I wan't actually trying to help.  Just a bit of humor.
113617 Qiana :  maybe nedit?
113617 Lourdes :  Lianne: I could write a basic bash script, but I don't know how to make one to do what I'm looking for
113620 Claretha *  left the room (quit: ).
113627 Arlie :  Horacio, im isolated, so i dont have a chance to be poisoned by the group mentality thing ... i wake up everyday, and im just me ;)
113628 Lourdes :  Qiana: well, I'm here trying to solve a problem -.-
113633 Jesse :  Colene: that;s a warning
113639 Gia :  warnings are ok
113641 Gia :  errors aren't
113642 Lourdes :  Qiana: dunno, never heard of that one o.o *tries it*
113643 Colene :  er whatever..
113646 Jesse :  Arlie: very wise
113649 Charlyn *  entered the room.
113652 Colene :  ok why are you calling  darkguy  darkgirl??
113659 Jesse :  Colene: tabtarding
113661 Colene :  yall are being mean..
113664 Lianne :  DARKGirl, all vim commands can be executed as a script in X mode "1,$ s/find_this/replace_with_this/g"  man vim
113667 Lianne :  woops
113674 Lianne :  Lourdes, thats for you
113677 Lourdes :  'cause there must be a DARKGirl in here, lol
113682 Colene :  ok
113687 Colene :  just wondering
113695 Colene :  still compiling..
113697 Arlie :  thats the one thing the world needs, more women

113713 Lourdes :  Lianne: what about multiline text? I can't place multiline text in a line of bash :/
113714 Lianne :  they'll take over the world monkey
113715 Colene :  oh   yeah we gonna  take over the whitehouse first though then the world..
113737 Arlie :  Lianne, rosie o donell doesnt count as a women ;)
113742 Riva *  entered the room.
113742 Lianne :  Lourdes, , replace one line at a time?
113743 Gia :  heh
113773 Anya :  how can I /easily/ create a chroot so that a user can use two apps: screen and irssi.
113780 Arlie :  and i think hilary clinton would have made an excellent borg queen
113784 Lourdes :  Lianne: nono, I need to find an occurrence of multiple lines at once (I'm trying to batch-edit an HTML file) and replace those with other bunch of lines
113800 Tonita :  Anya: try xen perhaps?
113806 Lianne :  "Let us put man and a woman together and find out which one is smarter...." Harry Belafonte - Man Smart (Woman Smarter)
113850 Arlie :  Lianne, i dont see it as a question of smarter ... its more, unique, and equally important, agendas that occasionally collide
113854 Anya :  Tonita: I'll look into it, thanks
113855 Lianne :  Lourdes,  then no gui tool, you will need a dangerous combination of sed, grep and awk
113882 Prince *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
113883 Tonita :  Anya: I wouldn't suggest it unless you have a distro that already has it well integrated.  you've never heard of xen?
113890 Lianne :  monkey, we both know that if men had give women a chance to power, they would be running the world by now
113894 Annette *  entered the room.
113897 Lianne :  ^given
113903 Laurene :  Tonita: I heared dr. Freeman was in Xen?
113910 Annette *  left the room.
113917 Arlie :  Lianne, ah ... but they run the world now ... its just the men dont know it ;)
113917 Lourdes :  Lianne: dangit, that's the thing that keeps users from migrating =/ guess I'll recurse to emulating EditPad through Wine =/
113927 Anya :  marienz: from xensource.com? sounds kindof like overkill
113936 Laurene :  Lourdes: isnt wine fore loosers? why not use linux editor
113953 Francisco :  Nicki: does rc.local run after network or before?
113959 Lianne :  Arlie, yeah, i think so too, but at least its more implicit now
113959 Tonita :  Laurene: you'll have to forgive me as I only vaguely get that probably.  haven't played half life 2 and all.
113962 Lourdes :  Laurene: because I can't find one that can find & replace multiple lines at once, do you know any
113966 Lourdes :  ?
113977 Laurene :  Lourdes: I use sed for that purpose
113983 Lourdes :  Laurene: sed's no GUI editor
113984 Arlie :  Lianne, they are the wizard of oz, behind the curtain, pushing the buttons and pulling the levers
113986 Laurene :  or vim  s/foo/bar/g
113997 Laurene :  actually... ANY editor have Replace All command...
113997 Glynda *  entered the room.
114000 Lourdes :  Laurene: multiple lines? that can't do multiple lines as far as I know :P
114000 Lianne :  you said it brother!
114006 Laurene :  try Eclipser
114014 Anya :  Tonita: nope
114020 Laurene :  or vim or emacs
114065 Lourdes :  Laurene: vim/emacs are for astronauts, there's no way I can learn how to use that just to do a simple task -.-' I'll try Eclipser as you said :P
114073 Lianne :  God bless anyone who still uses emacs
114080 Harold *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
114093 Laurene :  Lourdes: vim takes a month - or a weak of intensive learning
114096 Laurene :  week
114109 Lianne :  for find and replace?
114109 Lourdes :  Laurene: I need to do this for tomorrow =)
114120 Laurene :  ok ;) so next timethen
114121 Lucretia *  entered the room.
114139 Lucretia :  How much can .tar.gz reduce file size?
114144 Rodolfo *  entered the room.
114154 Lianne :  not more than tar.bz can
114187 Lianne :  or tar.bz2 even
114191 Jesse :  Lucretia: tar not at all, gzip varies according to the amount of redundancy in the material to be compressed ;)
114204 Arlinda *  left the room ("Coming Back").
114204 Arlinda *  entered the room.
114217 Kizzy *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
114218 Jesse :  and other factors, but that's the main one
114230 Lucretia :  Hmm
114231 Lianne :  You can tar.bz2 a 300gb file into a few kb
114240 Lianne :  (if the file is full of 0s)
114247 Lucretia :  I'm tar.gz a full web-hosting home directory
114259 Lianne :  tar.bz2 it
114262 Lucretia :  what would the general range of that be?
114270 Lucretia :  Lianne, not possible at the moment
114274 Lianne :  80%
114283 Jesse :  Lucretia: depends ;)
114294 Jesse :  Lucretia: text compresses well, jpegs not at al
114296 Jesse :  ll
114298 Lucretia :  80% of the original size?
114299 Jesse :  ugh
114302 Lianne :  yeah
114311 Lucretia :  Thanks
114355 Jesse :  Lucretia: ditto pngs and gifs, as they are already compressed
114362 Lucretia :  Yeah
114405 Gia :  the only types of graphics that will compress are .bmp and uncompressed .tif and maybe a small numbers of others
114405 Willene *  entered the room.
114428 Hiedi *  entered the room.
114496 Lianne :  png can also be compressed, but not if your already using png compression
114514 Darline *  entered the room.
114553 Lashawna :  can you use ssh to transfer files?
114559 Lianne :  scp
114578 Lianne :  rsync even, both use ssh protocol
114589 Raquel *  entered the room.
114624 Raquel :  hey guys!  do you know of any calendar and agenda program that works in a terminal (ie via ssh) ?
114639 Shira :  It's not entierly true, tar,bz2 .rar and her others might compress the image a bit further. As the algos works in different ways.
114663 Lianne :  Lashawna, scp root@my-friends-house:/home/mike/porno/Gia.jpg /home/Lashawna/porno/
114710 Jeffry *  entered the room.
114725 Jeffry :  hi. how do i check if i have internet connection?
114728 Velva *  entered the room.
114732 Lianne :  Compression is an art, ive studied quite a bit of it, but my knowledge is pre-2000 jpeg type of knowledge
114741 Velva :  whats the app that routes a serial console to tcp/ip ?
114744 Jeffry :  in linux?
114745 Lianne :  ping google.com
114756 Madison *  entered the room.
114783 Raquel :  Jeffry, try /sbin/ifconfig (to see if you have an ip, then try ping your gateway, then ping google)
114794 Frida *  left the room (quit: "gone").
114798 Lianne :  Velva, a combo of minicom and ssh?

114850 Jeffry :  how do i check if my mouse is working correctly?
114859 Laurene :  Jeffry: move it

114871 Laurene :  Capt. Obvious helps again
114880 Velva :  Lianne, yes .. that works. .. but i dont need minicom do i ... can just use /dev/ttyso
114886 Velva :  ?
114888 Laurene :  Jeffry: Your mouse is not working correctly.
114891 Laurene :  Capt. Obvious helps yet again
114897 Jeffry :  Laurene : thanks! that helps

114972 Lianne :  Laurene, it was redesigned to use wavelets (jpeg2000 used fourier series)
114981 Velva :  instead of minicom, ctrl-alt f4 ... but for serial ?
114995 Lianne :  (which caused, bleeding between contrasting colours)

115096 Raquel :  Madison, i don't see any reason to stray away from apache... '=|
115108 Gia :  Colene: older system?
115130 Kori *  saw a 16 core machine today at the office
115139 Lura :   I noticed that /var/log/boot is not getting logged to when one of my machines boots up, any idea's why it isn't being logged to ?
115141 Gia :  Madison: i used apache for years. i now use lighttpd. i really like it. easier to configure, much faster, takes far less resources
115143 Mitzie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
115158 Velva :  Lianne, yes I am .. but do I need minicom ?

115195 Leola *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
115203 Madison :  Gia: the app i am installing uses a mod rewrite for apache
115208 Lianne :  Velva, if you want to connect to a serial device (not CTL+ALT+F1,2,3..) then you need minicom, if you want to take over a pts, you might look into screen
115211 Madison :  so i kinda got to use apache
115230 Gia :  Raquel: it can. i'm experienced in such things, and it's a royal pain. light just comes out of the box taking far less. worksforme
115240 Gia :  Madison: so does the app i use, gallery, but I was able to get it to work with it
115243 Colene :  its a 2 ghz
115263 Madison :  Gia: i dont knwo the equivalent
115272 Raquel :  Gia, I've taken a couple minutes to make a good httpd.conf, then emailed it to my gmail, now I will always an easy and efficient apache
115278 Gia :  Madison: probably a good question for #lighttpd , i forget how i did it
115286 Gia :  Raquel: ok, works for you, doesn't work for me
115293 Raquel :  Gia, but i agree about the "out of the box" easyness
115294 Lianne :  emailed it , haha
115297 Velva :  oh so console>screen uses pts
115322 Raquel :  Lianne, yea, in case there is an earthquake and my hd, backup and cd backup all die

115485 Oretha :  Is there any FOSS toll to convert psd [photoshop] files to gifs/jpegs?
115497 Georgina :  hello hello anyone home
115500 Alisa :  Oretha: the gimp can do it.
115500 Gia :  ncftp is a good console client for linux, i would not be surprised if there is a windows version
115503 Lianne :  Cant the gimper open psd?
115505 Billi *  entered the room.
115512 Raquel :  so nice, amazon just made another record for me: 36 hours from order to arrival!
115534 Gia :  Oretha: gimp can open some of them, and from there you could save as whatever you want
115542 Georgina :  Madison: use the cli ftp
115551 Raquel :  Lianne, i had trouble with that, it depends a lot (used to work with designers)
115588 Kori *  was never 1337 enough to use photoshop
115592 Raquel :  Lianne, those containing slicing information will not open if i remember right (that was about 6 months ago)
115602 Georgina :  maya is the way to go

116091 Jesse :  Oretha: convert
116110 Oretha :  I want to watch, not convert :)
116121 Kimiko *  entered the room.
116137 Gia :  it probably can't deal with those either. the problem is the format you're trying to use is closed and proprietary. good luck.
116149 Whitley *  entered the room.

116304 Roger *  mumbles 'sklyariv'
116311 Jesse :  er, sklyarov
116328 Oretha :  Yeah, well, it's also standard, and the best one to use when printing shirts at the local print-a-shirt shack
116336 Jesse :  Laurene: his internets were taken away
116346 Jesse :  Oretha: they can't use pdf?
116358 Oretha :  Nope, trensperacy issues
116367 Garnet *  left the room (quit: "Oh, so thats what that thing does").
116371 Jesse :  Oretha: pretty stupid to 'standardise' on a secret file format
116373 Jesse :  Oretha: png
116402 Oretha :  png is a decent alternative, but psd works fine too, and it's not like anyone but me and the shirts guy is gonna see them
116415 Laurene :  Horacio: lol?
116417 Oretha :  I don't know how to use png well enough :/
116440 Filomena *  entered the room.
116444 Oretha :  And it's a shame, because it's probably the best format for storing digital images

116509 Laurene :  Horacio: he wasnt like, assasinate by 1984node ninjas or something?
116510 Jesse :  Oretha: what's to know? pmg does alpha channel; OTOH, it doesn't do layers, but you don't need that
116517 Georgina :  xpilot
116531 Filomena :  xpilot hehe
116535 Oretha :  layers are mighty useful
116544 Leola *  entered the room.

116577 Danette *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
116591 Danette *  entered the room.
116597 Jesse :  Oretha: sure - gimp's native format supports layers and all sorts of stuff
116613 Oretha :  Yeah, but gimp is barely usable
116615 Jesse :  Oretha: then save as png for printing
116648 Gia :  gimp is fine, i've used it for rediculous ammounts of stuff
116653 Oretha :  That's the issue, I had no idea wether it's any good for printing purposes
116656 Gia :  maybe unusable for you
116665 Oretha :  We have a high budget graphic studio around here
116673 Jesse :  Oretha: I don't find it so; but this is irrelevant; just save your photoshop stuff as png when you're done
116679 Winter *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
116702 Jesse :  Oretha: png is fine for printing - why wouldn't it be?
116712 Oretha :  I dunno, a lot of formats aren't
116719 Laurene :  Oretha: what the hell
116733 Katie :  it depends what you mean by fine for printing
116749 Jesse :  Oretha: in what way?
116754 Oretha :  It has to use the same colour channels as the printing equipment, and have high DPI
116788 Oretha :  You can't print jpeg files if you want to get a fine result
116801 Na *  left the room (quit: ).
116802 Jesse :  Oretha: no, jpeg is lossy compression
116807 Chanelle *  left the room ("Leaving").
116814 Gia :  you could use uncompressed tiff and be fine
116815 Julius *  entered the room.
116817 Katie :  DPI isn't really a huge issue, thats just a case of how big you decide to make the pixels at print time. Its the colour channels that are the big deal for those in proffesional printing.
116819 Tomoko *  entered the room.
116831 Krystina *  entered the room.
116834 Gia :  dpi is a huge issue in printing
116851 Oretha :  Well, I'm not in proffesional printing, but my mom is, so I let her do that stuff for me to get optimal resulst :)
116862 Glynda *  entered the room.
116872 Oretha :  But then again, she has no reason to use PNG, she paid good money for her copy of CS2
116885 Katie :  sure but its not really an issue with the format, as long as the format lets you make arbiterally large images and the printer knows what size to print it at the format doesn't have to get involved with DPI
116898 Riva *  left the room (quit: ).
116922 Gia :  anyway to make life easier in the future don't use proprietary formats... locks you in, as you can see
116945 Brinda *  left the room (quit: "Demetra").
116951 Oretha :  Katie, yeah, I know, the main issue is that I had no idea is capable for arbitrary DPI values, or it's stuck on 72 dpi
116952 Madison *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
116960 Laurene :  I would people could un-do flash format and player.
116963 Laurene :  *wish
116983 Filomena :  d
116985 Gia :  or get rid of it period... annoying
116987 Laurene :  flash - the most sucking thing in Internet, since IE
116995 Katie :  Oretha png doesn't care about dpi, a png is just a grid of pixels what size those pixels are shown at is up to the application interpreting it
117002 Oretha :  flash itself is nice, it's just being abuesd
117018 Laurene :  Oretha: flash is horrible since its closed - so I can play it on regular linux
117025 Laurene :  can't

117051 Laurene :  Horacio: does it play even youtube?
117063 Rodolfo :  Laurene: soon
117065 Laurene :  the free player plugin in debian fails even for simple youtube video
117067 Katie :  if by regular linux you mean lintel than firefox has no trouble fetching the flash plugin, those with other architectures are out of luck though
117069 Jesse :  Laurene: not sure if it does yet, ask in #gnash perhaps

117115 Jesse :  Laurene: you'll need cvs/svn gnash, it's 'under heavy development'
117117 Rodolfo :  gnash is going to play flv videos throw gstreamer i think
117120 Katie :  If you are designing for a CMYK process you really want to produce your output in CMYK. Not produce it in RGB and hope it gets converted right. That means you can't use PNG You can use TIFF though.
117131 Troy *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
117160 Oretha :  I don't know wether they use CMYK or RGB
117178 Oretha :  But they do use photoshop, so they could set the proper color scheme

117414 Oretha :  Kemberly, what cand of audio device?
117423 Oretha :  *kind, sorry
117451 Kemberly :  Oretha: any usb speaker basically, I am considering purchasing one for an older computer that seems to have a dead sound card
117464 Oretha :  A speaker requires a soundcard, yeah
117465 Laurene :  usb... speaker? wtf
117503 Kemberly :  Oretha: so it wouldn't have its own soundcard built into the usb device? because I have seen usb speakers that claim to be a sound card
117503 Oretha :  Laurene, they exist
117511 Krystina *  is now known as Krystina
117520 Sherwood *  is now known as Sherwood
117522 Oretha :  If they claim to also be a sound card, then they wouldn't require the internal sound card
117525 Katie :  usb audio devices have nothing to do with the computers soundcard
117536 Raquel :  Kemberly, most likely you need a software driver for that, on linux?...
117550 Raquel :  just like a software modem
117560 Katie :  no more than two soundcards have anything to do with each other
117570 Kemberly :  Raquel: as in purchase it from someone link linuxant?
117578 Katie :  you would have to research compatibility if you wanted it to work on linux though

119524 Maryjane *  entered the room.
119526 Laurene :  how to generate second, separated SSH key and use it in ssh connection as pubkey
119530 Johnnie :  Apparently enough to mystify me :-(.
119547 Johnnie :  Lajuana: I have a crossover cable connecting my laptop (ubuntu) with an appliance running cclinux.
119557 Johnnie :  I have a console on the appliance, too.
119558 Fatimah *  entered the room.
119561 Lajuana :  Johnnie: well, the difference is basically...a normal cable connects a computer to a hub. A crossover cable connects a computer to a computer or a hub to a hub.
119572 Lajuana :  There, there's all there is to know about crossover cables~
119579 Emmitt *  entered the room.
119582 Johnnie :  Lajuana: Georgia laptop is also on wireless, which is how I'm typing this.
119590 Johnnie :  Lajuana: Okay, so why can't I ping the applaince?
119594 Emmitt :  i installed ndiswrapper, but i still have no wireless... what am i missing?
119602 Emmitt :  i also installed the driver
119614 Johnnie :  Lajuana: That is, the appliance is configured to have a static IP of 192.168.1.50, but pinging that IP gets me "destination unreachable".

119884 Lajuana :  Johnnie: and you routing tables are set up right, the interface is configured and reports that it has link, etc?
119887 Katie :  Whitney well it depends, if you have an uplink port or auto-mdix on one of the hubs you can use a straight cable
119905 Lajuana :  Whitney: only if it has an uplink port, which implements the crossover part in the hub itself
119906 Katie :  but otherwise you need a crossover cable
119918 Whitney :  Katie - how often do you find those in 2007?
119940 Lajuana :  Whitney: constantly, when you're scavenging old hardware from work :P

120136 Sharolyn *  entered the room.
120136 Lajuana :  And the default varies from client to client, and some don't /have/ defaults but instead ask you for each torrent or when they first start up.

120145 Lajuana :  ...

121368 Julius :  i tried azureus too
121384 Julius :  i download it and it always comes as a java source package which needs to be compiled
121385 Mildred :  oh
121387 Pete :  anyone here knows the relationship between sendmail and dns trying to resolve a issue

121411 Julius :  a domain?
121419 Cornelius :  Pete, is it not allowing certain e-mails from some domains?
121427 Julius :  no, i just have no idea how to compile these crazy java projects
121429 Pete :  just from my server
121445 Julius :  couldnt find anything about it on google cause everyone else apparently just runs ./azureus and they are done
121447 Pete :  lets see sendmail log is what path again.
121464 Laree :  Julius: what is azureus?
121475 Julius :  java bittorrent client
121480 Arlie :  Laree, get real, its not a tax per email, its an internet tax in general
121490 Laree :  Julius: why are you using torrents? warez kiddy?
121506 Mildred :  torrents aren't just for pirating

121648 Laree :  Arlie: huh?
121656 Gisela *  shrugs, free shiz when you get old
121664 Laurene :  I wonder whey there will GTFO of 'nam II
121666 Arlie :  and honestly, i think taxing information aka the internet isnt a good idea, since really, consumers should be consuming more information, and less physical crap
121667 Laree :  Arlie: i thought taxes were for creating secret governmental organizations that house UFOs...
121672 Betsey *  entered the room.

121737 Laree :  dark fiber is yummy
121743 Lacie *  suggests everyone get some in their diet
121757 Laree :  it tastes like internet potential
121763 Mildred :  there programs that look for stuff that has been deleted but not erased
121764 Arlie :  taxes, and the us dollars they must be paid with, is what creates work
121770 Mildred :  *are there programs that look for stuff that has been deleted but not erased
121785 Arlie :  if there were no taxes, you wouldnt need to work
121801 Julius :  im sure they have some involvment with the laying of our fiber networks
121801 Arlie :  at least, not in the normal traditional sense
121805 Fe *  entered the room.
121811 Julius :  they have to, its too important to leave to some company
121831 Laree :  Arlie: what if tax money was spend on some energy saving project that ended up working, but the company that was appointed the money decided to scrap the project because of private companies pressuring them. (even though the tax payer money was already spent)  what do you think of that?
121833 Arlie :  dude .. you live in dream world if you think the gov doesnt fuck up important shit on a daily basis
121844 Shella :  demand and people willing to supply makes work ?
121847 Julius :  if there were no taxes we would have no police, welfare, medi*, etc...
121853 Laree :  s/spend/spent/

121897 Julius :  pixies
121904 Arlie :  Julius, it grows on trees ;)
121905 Julius :  comes from a mint
121905 Laree :  Arlie: the fed makes money. :)
121913 Arlie :  right ... its just dirty paper
121913 Julius :  lol, the best things always do
121933 Arlie :  to get money, you are required by law to borrow it from the source
121942 Laree :  Arlie: they say, "hrm. the economy is growing big enough now. let's create some more money out of thin air." (they're the fed, they can do that sort of thing.)
121943 Arlie :  or borrow it from someone who borrowed it from the source
121948 Arlie :  its all borrowed from the gov
121963 Eustolia *  entered the room.
121971 Arlie :  now ... why do people borrow the dirty paper ?
121983 Arlie :  because you need it to pay taxes
121988 Laree :  Arlie: wouldn't that make the govt the most loss-y-est investment in history? heh
121991 Arlie :  you can pay taxes with chickens or eggs
121994 Arlie :  er..cant
122005 Laree :  Arlie: sure you can
122008 Julius :  you dont borrow money
122011 Julius :  you exchange it
122012 Laree :  Arlie: oh wait, this isn't the 19th century. :)
122014 Arlie :  Laree, shut up, you can not
122024 Arlie :  Julius, huh ?
122033 Laree :  Arlie: in the days of kings and fair maidens you could
122035 Arlie :  Julius, currency is borrowed from the issuer
122038 Julius :  how would you borrow money? a loan i guess
122053 Arlie :  Julius, the fed loans it to banks which loans it to people and businesses
122054 Julius :  currently is exchanged, only borrows are from banks
122061 Laree :  Julius: a loan that is never paid back. lol. that is why we have this huge huge HUGE national debt. ;)
122068 Julius :  in reality we are borrowing the symbolic value of our gold in the form of paper
122078 Mildred :  i thought this was a support channel!
122078 Arlie :  exchanging of 1 currency for another has nothing to do with its origination, which is the gov
122086 Janyce *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
122089 Laree :  Julius: but whoever has the pointy sticks can just keep saying, "well, we'll pay it back next year" (they use the police for this)
122094 Julius :  have huge national debt because we over spend and lose our damn money
122097 Arlie :  Julius, the US hasnt run on the gold standard since 1970

122126 Garrett *  left the room (quit: "Garrett").
122127 Arlie :  Julius, so the dollar has nothing to do with the price of gold
122136 Laree :  Arlie: where does the "consumer who goes crazy with a credit card" fit into this? :->
122142 Julius :  it might not use the gold as a exact standard but that is part of what regulates the mints
122150 Arlie :  Julius, no its not
122161 Arlie :  40 years ago it was, but not today
122170 Julius :  huh, thot it did to an extent
122177 Arlie :  and all that did was regulate the amount loaned out, ie the amount in circulation
122184 Julius :  guess not... you would think it partially does though
122202 Julius :  yea
122203 Arlie :  money grows on trees
122207 Monnie :  heh
122209 Arlie :  it has no value by itself

122268 Arlie :  either sales tax, or gas tax, or property tax, or whatever, everything is taxed
122268 Laree :  Arlie: it's like paying a huge maphia some "protection money" heh
122271 Monnie :  life lessons in #linux
122276 Arlie :  Laree, thats exactly what it is
122286 Karmen *  entered the room.
122287 Arlie :  and taxes must be paid with currency
122288 Laree :  Arlie: of course the govt doesn't actually fight wars. they outsource that to the people themselves by putting out carrots on a stick. ;)
122296 Arlie :  so taxes create the demand for money
122306 Julius :  everything creates demand
122315 Arlie :  and its the system of taxes and money, that regulates the consumption of the population
122317 Laree :  Julius: does sex create demand? </sarcasm>
122320 Monnie :  ah yes... modern day slavery
122320 Monnie :  ;)
122325 Julius :  yes heh
122325 Candra *  left the room (quit: "bah").

122620 Julius :  slaves are actually the most effective way to run a economy securely if you think about it
122629 Laree :  Arlie: it's best to be in such a lowly and depressed company when that happens. :)
122637 Arlie :  Julius, modern economies have something better
122645 Julius :  super slaves?
122645 Arlie :  Julius, economic slaves who think they are free
122648 Laree :  Arlie: because assets stay within a company. you're buying them up cheap and eventually it will skyrocket. :)
122659 Laree :  Julius: super slaves? lol

122718 Arlie :  Julius, you want workers to be happy
122721 Julius :  theyll like it...
122726 Laree :  Arlie: sure it does
122736 Laree :  Arlie: you can be a slave in the fields, a house slave...
122742 Arlie :  Julius, economic slavery allows them to find the jobs they like, but they must still work
122775 Arlie :  so it boosts overall output
122778 Laree :  Arlie: i bet some day slaves everywhere will invent a system like monster.com where they can pick the best slave jobs
122780 Laree :  lol
122781 Julius :  i never heard the 40 yo guy at mcd's or burger king talkin about how much they liked the job they chose

123139 Kathleen :  is 90 dollars
123140 Monnie :  no
123146 Laree :  Kathleen: define good
123151 Kathleen :  so i think it must be good
123156 Laree :  Kathleen: all PSUs die. even very expensive ones
123156 Monnie :  no
123163 Monnie :  powersupplies are just more expensive now
123171 Melda :  $90?!
123174 Monnie :  $150-200 is normal.
123176 Kathleen :  well i can get one for 15 dollars
123184 Mildred :  I got a good one for $50
123188 Kathleen :  and then is the 90 one
123195 Kathleen :  it has rtoc ost more
123197 Laree :  Mildred: how do you know it's good? :)
123197 Melda :  hrm... my 500watter's with a 5.25" fan and a 80mm fan normally run maybe $35-50
123202 Kathleen :  because theres a reason no?
123213 Laree :  Mildred: did you run resistive load tests on it until it failed? (then you'd have to buy another one. heh)
123218 Melda :  i presume mine are good because i've yet to have one die... since say '97 or so
123225 Mildred :  Laree: I compared it to others on the site

123283 Kathleen :  you have to input them in the ps
123287 Kathleen :  then in thge devicxe
123290 Melda :  Merri: sounds like your process limited on the system in like /etc/security/limits.conf or something else like that and/or you're trying to do a fork-bomb and you're process limited in another manner
123299 Danyelle *  entered the room.
123325 Merri :  thanks
123341 Laree :  there's many ways to say how good a power supply is. how much current you can source is usually the only listed one. hah
123341 Danyelle :  hey a system build for x86_64 can be x36_mmx compatible
123362 Mildred :  Laree: I'm tring to find it on newegg
123369 Melda :  Merri: i take it this is a system you're not rooted on? - also a common thing on a VE pending how the admin has it setup
123375 Mildred :  Laree: I'm not too sure what makes a good ps, maybe I got a badone
123384 Melda :  if tha thappened on your box and you didn't set process limits then i'm not sure
123388 Laree :  Mildred: ... no. PSUs *do* die.
123410 Melda :  Laree: oh hell yeah they do - nice burnt-plastic/rott smell when they blow too
123412 Laree :  Mildred: fan can die.... coils can short or change capacitance....
123412 Johnnie :  Lajuana: Routing tables on my laptop or on the cclinux box?
123417 Danyelle :  can a x86_64 run on ix86 machine
123435 Laree :  Mildred: overvoltage can happen. overcurrent can happen...
123448 Mildred :  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817159040">COOLMAX CP-500T EPS12V 500W Power Supply - Retail</a>

123511 Melda :  Mildred: get a mediocre PS and a really good backup battery to watch for over/under currents and such
123517 Mildred :  I should have got one with SLI...
123543 Danyelle :  can a x86_64 apps run on iax86 (mmx compatible, i586) machine
123545 Laree :  Melda: ?? battery backup won't help with a UPS
123549 Shella :  they say you can generally tell if a power supply is well made by how heavy it is, the heavier the better
123550 Alexis *  left the room.
123557 Laree :  Melda: er.... battery backup won't help a cheap PSU
123563 Laree :  Melda: you could get dual PSUs
123583 Melda :  a good ups will protect from most current changes @ the power/wall side
123605 Laree :  Melda: sure, but it can still wear down, or be drawing too much current, etc. etc.
123618 Melda :  hence "protect" not "eliminate" ;)
123632 Laree :  Melda: depends how critical the system is. :)
123650 Laree :  Melda: is it worth the extra money to buy a $500 PSU, or is it just a cheapo system
123654 Melda :  Laree: if he has to ask about a power supply, i'm betting 10 to 1 it's far from critical
123686 Laree :  Mildred: is this a cheapo server or what?
123691 Danyelle :  can a x86_64 apps run on iax86 (mmx compatible, i586) machine!!!!!!!!!!!!!
123696 Ninfa *  entered the room.
123705 Shella :  Danyelle: why would you want to do that

123715 Laree :  oh. hahah. even more cheapo
123722 Mildred :  ?
123731 Laree :  Mildred: why the ?
123732 Mildred :  i don't see anytihng wrong with it
123737 Mildred :  what's so cheapo
123747 Laree :  Mildred: you need more expensive parts in a server
123751 Forrest :  i'd recommend silentpcreview.com for good psu reviews
123754 Mildred :  (I just want to know so I can get a better one next time)
123763 Melda :  Mildred: he's saying you don't need an expensive one as it's not a huge/critical system
123763 Laree :  Mildred: many people are depending on it. spending the extra 10% is worth it for any increase in reliability.
123767 Mildred :  oh
123773 Mildred :  i gotcha
123808 Glynda *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
123818 Shella :  just get a coolermaster green series one or an antec or something
123838 Mildred :  Laree - so does it look ok for home use?
123839 Danyelle :  Shella, for download a iso... i don't have experience with x64 soft ....
123841 Laree :  Melda: exactly. a "not expensive one" is a cheapo one. :)
123862 Laree :  Melda: a "cheap as crap" one is an emachines one. :})
123864 Alena *  entered the room.
123873 Shella :  if your cpu doesn't support 64 bit instructions then x86_64 binaries wont run on it
123876 Laree :  Mildred: sure, why not. :)
123877 Danyelle :  Shella, every time have ia32
123899 Harold *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
123899 Mildred :  Laree: ok : ) "cheapo" threw me off a little
123904 Mildred :  i wasn't sure
123917 Laree :  Mildred: how so? it is literally what you are thinking. :)
123955 Glynda *  entered the room.
123957 Demetra :  i've been watching Scrubs all day
123958 Mildred :  I say cheapo to mean crap, and inexpensive to mean ok, but not expensive... that's me though
123965 Laree :  Demetra: shame on you
123969 Demetra :  Laree, why?
123971 Laree :  Demetra: imagine how turk would feel

124034 Isabella :  probably assembled in china
124038 Talia :  There, all in one line!
124039 Demetra :  :(
124041 Gale :  I prefer hand made
124044 Mildred :  if it was that flaky it wouldn't be $60
124045 Laree :  Isabella: 90% probability that is true
124048 Demetra :  but i dont wanna go to daddy
124071 Laree :  Demetra: did you watch the part yet where they all got scooters? lol
124079 Mildred :  would it

124155 Laree :  Demetra: i'll give you a spoiler
124160 Talia :  Demetra: your dad is ypur master, your dad is /dev/Demetra, He already annihilated you
124168 Laree :  Demetra: he's still calling him "newbie" in the most current season. LOL! :)
124168 Mildred :  Laree: the rebate on newegg brings it down to $40
124181 Laree :  Mildred: so it must only cost them $20 to produce it then. hehehe

124280 Laree :  what do you think the most expensive part in a power supply is? heh
124289 Laree :  i'd probably think either the metal enclosure, or the coils
124326 Isabella :  i wonder if they solder all that crap by hand
124344 Laree :  Isabella: no
124349 Laree :  Isabella: they have a soldier bath
124358 Talia :  Demetra: I'm just messing with you, you may speak now
124373 Ahmad *  entered the room.
124378 Toya *  entered the room.
124379 Laree :  Isabella: they place all the small components by machine. then they have worker slaves hand place the larger components. then they have the whole thing dipped in a soldier bath.
124398 Laree :  Isabella: then they do tests to make sure it actually turns on. (this says nothing really for the long term stability)
124408 Toya :  who builds a computer like this

124563 Toya :  now i know i am not - and your overview explains sone horrid design i see in dells
124569 Kathleen *  is now known as Kathleen
124580 Laree :  a PSU just needs to respond to things like 5VSB, and also not to overcurrent, and also to oscillate stuff. so they may or may not be using a micro controller for those things. heh. (probably not. too costly.)
124615 Kathleen *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
124617 Toya :  5V 12V negavive and positive
124621 Lavern *  entered the room.
124638 Laree :  if you're talking about a $500 PSU, 90% probability it does have a dedicated microprocessor inside also monitoring it's own temperature, current draws, fun stuff like that that you don't get on a cheapo supply.
124660 Toya :  have an antec

125034 Laree :  Rhett: root access would allow them. :)
125041 Julius :  you can have it load during bootup
125050 Laree :  what is a "service port"?
125062 Julius :  its a port that needs privs from the os
125065 Toya :  head i think he means he wants the user to listen to a specified service it telnet running on 23
125071 Arlie :  Rhett, sure, just bind to the port and listen() ;)
125077 Stefany *  entered the room.
125079 Laree :  it sounds like something sexual. "service port"

125208 Rhett :  Arlie, because those ports are reserved for well known services
125223 Arlie :  no, those ports are reserved for services...period
125230 Laree :  Rhett: you run something as root that lets them interface to those ports
125233 Makeda *  entered the room.
125235 Gale :  and somehow the "service ports" aren't?
125249 Arlie :  in other words, if you get a client socket, and initiate a connection to a remote host, the socket you get wont be < 1024
125261 Emilie *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
125262 Arlie :  since those are reserved for services
125268 Laree :  Arlie: that's what she said. :)
125271 Toya :  by default
125282 Arlie :  instead, the kernel will typically give you the lowest unused port > 1023
125296 Makeda :  anyone in here have experience with myphpadmin
125299 Arlie :  but that has nothing to do with actually calling bind() on a port below 1024
125304 Laree :  Makeda: what is that?
125305 Deirdre *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
125305 Isabella :  Makeda: yes.
125310 Laree :  Makeda: you mean phpmyadmin?
125316 Makeda :  yes
125330 Makeda :  I have a server running fedora core 5
125334 Makeda :  and xampp
125341 Lona *  entered the room.
125373 Makeda :  can you recomend a good turorial for learning how to build databases and linking them to the website I have loaded
125415 Laree :  Makeda: did you try google yet?
125418 Makeda :  or a good book maybe
125418 Rhett :  Arlie, make a c program that just listens on port 50 .. then output the error message to the console
125425 Cristina *  left the room (quit: "Leaving.").
125429 Laree :  Makeda: try specifics
125431 Frida *  left the room (quit: "gone").
125432 Elijah *  entered the room.
125436 Laree :  Makeda: what database. what linking language
125442 Elijah :  is it possible to make the default midi driver timidity?
125446 Arlie :  Rhett, no, i just found out that linux does prevent binding below port 1024
125450 Makeda :  I don't think we have time for specifics
125454 Arlie :  unless the process is root
125457 Demetra :  i'm 60% done with my 40 and feeling it :)
125458 Laree :  Makeda: who is we
125459 Rhett :  Arlie, yeah i know
125462 Demetra :  time to code
125462 Makeda :  I want to link with php
125469 Arlie :  but it makes 0 sense from a security standpoint
125474 Laree :  Makeda: and the database?
125485 Arlie :  in any case, servers start as root, then switch to another user
125487 Rhett :  Arlie, yes it does
125502 Makeda :  I am true novice and before I waste your time with braod knowledge needs I want to try to educate myself a little more
125504 Arlie :  Rhett, tell me how it affects security when you have a firewall that can block any port you want ?
125510 Jenae *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
125513 Laree :  Makeda: try this
125517 Laree :  Makeda: mysql / PHP
125525 Laree :  Makeda: there are many MANY books on just that.
125527 Makeda :  for a google search
125539 Rhett :  Arlie, i want to listen on a < 1024 port so i can fool my isp bit torrent shaping
125551 Makeda :  I know there are that is whay I am asking for recommendations
125562 Arlie :  fine, run a proxy as root and tunnel through it
125568 Velva :  how do you make amarok scan several devices, ie /dev/cdrom & /dev/dvd ?
125575 Laree :  Makeda: well you needed to give specifics first. there are many databases out there, many web/linking languages
125599 Arlie :  it doesnt actually need to run as root, it just needs to bind as root
125626 Arlie :  you could, alternately, rewrite the packets
125627 Toya :  anybody here know a website i can go to that has basic linux tutotials 0 similar in content to Linux+
125628 Makeda :  I want to learn how to use the mysql and phpmyadmin I have loaded so I can create a forum
125629 Laree :  Arlie: use selinux and be done with it. :)
125650 Regenia *  entered the room.
125658 Laree :  Makeda: why do you want to create one when there are so many already out there
125664 Arlie :  but im suspecting Rhett doesnt have a root account
125667 Demetra :  from what i saw the contents of the Linux+ exam are a joke. just know how to install and configure RHEL?
125675 Demetra :  *heard, never took the Linux+ exam personally
125684 Makeda :  so many what?
125688 Elaine *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
125690 Julio *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
125692 China *  entered the room.
125695 Laree :  Arlie: ??? if that's the case, he is asking, "how do i run programs to listen on ports i don't have access to"
125696 China :  hi
125700 Makeda :  I want to add a forum to one of my websites
125701 Demetra :  Makeda, phpbb3
125705 Arlie :  Laree, pretty much
125710 Demetra :  China, hi
125711 Laree :  Arlie: that's dumb
125713 Elaine *  entered the room.
125716 Rhett :  yes i do have a root account i just don't want to run the actual program as root
125717 Toya :  correct Demetra - that annd at commands
125720 Keisha *  entered the room.
125728 Demetra :  Toya, at commands?  what are those?
125729 Toya :  which is why i am disapointed with it even though i passed
125731 Arlie :  Rhett, run it as a normal user and switch
125746 Afton *  entered the room.
125746 Rhett :  switch?
125752 Toya :  the commands used to signal a modem - attention dialtone ( atdt )
125758 Laree :  one of the questions on the Linux+ exam should be, "Do you know what a Eunic is?" heheheh
125760 Keisha *  left the room ("Konversation terminated!").

125816 China :  running some ol mailserver, you might wanna look at ftp://ftp.crashrecovery.org/pub/linux/amavis/ (the old fast one, without perl) and now also automaticly uses ClamAV 0.90.2 if installed
125818 Isabella :  Laree: no no, that's a test question. (:

125889 Arlie :  Rhett, setuid() sets the effective user id of a process ... so ... you start the process as root, and it switches ... this is how apache and mysql can bind to ports < 1024, or any other program for that matter
125890 Gregg :  you stop that :(
125895 Velva :  that only works as root, right .. 1 9
125896 China :  thats on a P3 500MHz machine
125913 Caren *  entered the room.
125917 Arlie :  Rhett, since we have concluded that only root processes can bind to ports < 1024, if you want to bind to one of those ports, it stands to reason, you must start your process as root
125922 Gale :  and somehow hacking your system so that users can arbitrarily use privileged ports is secure?
125940 Rhett :  Arlie, thank you, i think that will work
125944 Arlie :  Rhett, once you have started your process as root, since its root, it can call setuid() to become whatever other user it wants ... and it cant switch back ... so that closed the security hole
125944 Laree :  Gale: lol. exactly.
125958 Arlie :  Rhett, so ... socket() bind() setuid() listen()
125977 Arlie :  Rhett, or socket() bind() listen() setuid() ... whichever one works
125979 Makeda :  Demetra:  that would be an easy way I would kind of like to learn how to create a forum the hard way this is my summer project till classes start again
125993 Caren *  is now known as Caren
126008 Layla *  entered the room.
126021 Laree :  Arlie: "whatever floats yer eunic boat"
126027 Rhett :  Gale, it doesn't matter what port the progarm runs on as far as security
126027 Laree :  eunics boat
126029 Makeda :  I work full time too but I want to learn how to build a forum with the software on my home server
126048 Demetra :  Makeda, it requires a high level of expertise in php and mysql
126053 Kathleen :  how do i upload a podcast to my ipod?
126057 Demetra :  or basically, you have to know a programming language well
126059 Demetra :  very well
126066 Demetra :  do you know a programming language very well, Makeda ?
126072 Demetra :  a forum is very complex
126074 Laree :  Makeda: exactly what Demetra said. go get a PHP/Mysql book
126096 Jenae *  entered the room.
126098 Makeda :  Null: No I don't yet so any books you would recommend
126100 Laree :  Makeda: go hang out in a book store till you find the right one. only you will know which is the best one for you.
126108 Alysa *  entered the room.
126108 Demetra :  Makeda, i would recommend you learn Ruby on Rails
126114 Demetra :  it's state of the art, 2.0, and very powerful
126115 Laree :  Demetra: NO!!!!!
126117 Demetra :  and much easier than php/mysql
126121 Jenae :  What are some good lightweight distros?
126123 Laree :  ruby on rails is dumb. :(
126130 Demetra :  Jenae, DamnSmallLinux, Slackware
126134 Demetra :  Laree, why?
126147 Rhett :  Gale, if a protocol or a program is insecure it will be insecure on any port it runs on, if a protocol or program is secure it will be secure on any port it runs on
126151 Laree :  Demetra: just trying to start a meme
126159 Kathleen :  guys over here?
126160 Kathleen :  how do i upload a podcast to my ipod?
126161 Laree :  Demetra: so i don't have to learn a new language. :)
126164 Demetra :  Laree, what's a meme?
126171 Demetra :  Laree, RoR is absurdly easy o.o
126185 Laree :  Demetra: PHP is absurdly easy
126199 Georgeanna *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
126200 Demetra :  Laree, PHP is easy but overly complex when scaled
126202 Laree :  Demetra: there are so many examples on php.net and libraries out there, it's silly
126205 Gale :  Rhett: that's true, but it's the general accepted convention that <1024 ports are usually servers/daemons with sometimes rather high privs
126214 Makeda :  I can start learning a new language,  I have 3 months before classes start again and noting to do from 6PM to 9PM
126216 Demetra :  Laree, it's because it's been out much longer
126226 Gia *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
126231 Ninfa :  Can someone recommend a good command-line music player? I'm getting tired of mplayer's cpu-hogging phenomenon, and to my knowledge mplayer doesn't do playlists. Something with dbus support would be nice.
126237 Demetra :  Makeda, go learn Ruby on Rails.  while doing that, you'll also pick up a ton of SQL and some PHP
126247 Demetra :  Ninfa, one second
126248 Demetra :  cplay
126249 Laree :  what does dbus actually do anyway?
126265 Gale :  Rhett: they had to organize things somehow.  And all the other devs have and will make that assumption about every system since it's the convention.
126275 Rhett :  Gale, but it's not a security risk, unless i run #hackmenow --port 5
126279 Ninfa :  Laree: it's an inter-process communication framework, so you can have a dbus-compliant client send messages to dbus programs
126281 Makeda :  ok I will look into those thank you Null and all others who have weighed in
126306 Laree :  Ninfa: aren't there already dozens of IPCs out there? why make a new one?
126320 Laree :  Ninfa: CORBA, RPC, COM+...
126321 Demetra :  Makeda, wait
126322 Ninfa :  Laree: for instance, you write a script and bind it to a hotkey or mouse gesture in your desktop environment, so suddenly you have the ability to control your music player functions with your mouse
126323 Velva :  whats like c++ but better ?
126328 Demetra :  Makeda, i have a really good link for you
126330 Laree :  Ninfa: heck, you could even call SOAP one
126342 Rhett :  Gale, if i run #mostsecureprogramever --port 2 it won't matter what service normally runs on that port because that service wont be available
126343 Makeda :  cool can you email it to me
126362 Ninfa :  Laree: I'm looking for a music player not trying to make my own IPC. I mentioned dbus (although I don't know anything specific about it compared to dcop, which is the only one I'm slightly familiar with) because I know its name from kde4.0
126363 Makeda :  pleasr
126364 Santo :  Makeda: http://tryruby.hobix.com/
126367 Santo :  there it is
126372 Santo :  hope you appreciate it, ran across teh apartment
126373 Santo :  :)
126375 Santo :  now time to break the seal
126382 Johnnie :  Makeda: What langauges do you currently know?
126383 Ninfa :  Laree: IPC would be nice because I figure I could bind a program that interacts with the wiimote to it
126428 Regenia *  left the room.

126576 Mora *  entered the room.

126662 Makeda :  cool
126672 Makeda :  I am fairly new to linux

126851 Demetra :  Makeda, i've been into computers since 6 :)
126873 Ninfa :  Demetra: I have you beat, but I was learning the alphabet, not coding then.

126889 Glynda :  hey this guy told me that if i do sudo chmod -x chmod it would make my computer run faster, but when I asked him what to do next, he told logged off! can anyone help?
126890 Makeda :  I learned computer on atari basic and then lost touch for a lot of years
126890 Elijah :  its a man page for vkeybd
126902 Talia :  !help and then "cpu" is interesting
126906 Demetra :  Ninfa, i was coding in basic by copying examples from the back covers of magazines.... course i didn't know what i was doing since I didn't know English then... but I do remember using a lot of GOTO's ;)
126913 Demetra :  Learned on a Sincla Spectrum ZX
126914 Elijah :  i need to figure out how to use vkeybd --addr desetination or something to use 128:1 port instead of 129:0
126917 Ninfa :  Demetra: Heh
126920 Demetra :  *Sinclair
126929 Makeda :  wow thats old
126938 Ninfa :  so not to be too much of a bother, but again, does anyone have a favorite CLI music player?

126948 Chandra :  Ninfa: mplayer
126955 Darcel :  Arlie: you took the word out of my mouth :P
126959 Chandra :  Ninfa: but check out mp3blaster if you want a jukebox style one
126965 Gale :  Glynda: I bet that created a bit of dilemma -- chicken before the egg problem
126975 Ninfa :  triffid_hunter: That's the one I'm moving away from. Mplayer doesn't do playlists right? And it has cpu-spike problems for some reason
126994 Yang :  Glynda: he screwed you, that probably borked your system good, huh...
127001 Glynda :  I bet if I do ctrl-alt-backspace that will fix it.  that fixes everything.
127007 Talia :  Makeda: Linux is great for servers, it can stay on for more than 1 year at a time without slowing down or crashing
127016 Yang :  Glynda: not this one
127022 Gale :  Glynda: guess you'll now be having a bit of trouble changing mode on files lol
127032 Tova :  Ninfa: I've heard about mpd before... but never spent much time iwth it.
127062 Yang :  Glynda: reconfigure chmod, that should fix it
127073 Arlie :  Talia, you think thats cool, my windows box automatically reboots itself every day ;)
127081 Yang :  Glynda: hopefully...
127092 Talia :  lol
127103 Gale :  Glynda: guess you learned the importance of reading the man page
127105 Ninfa :  Tova: Mpd was the other one I heard about but forgot the name of recently. Thanks, googling it again...

127245 Talia :  Billye: man du
127248 Mellissa :  Hello. I have kernel 2.0 here. I need it to start with a console on tty00 (serial port). What is the option for a serial console on that kernel?
127264 Fannie :  Isabella: alright. can I turn Xorg off as well?
127270 Talia :  Fannie: turning the monitor off is the best you can do
127270 Bryon *  entered the room.

127319 Miles *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
127320 Talia :  if you know what a command line bittorrent client is, and how to use the command line, then yes, you may turn Xorg off, although the effect on the Eartha will be negligable
127337 Talia :  Xorg is compiling...
127346 Talia :  It'll take about 20 min.
127358 Ninfa :  why turn off X to use bittorrent?
127371 Rickie :  greeting friends
127377 Billye :  i can never remember the one that shows which process is locking a file...
127382 Talia :  saves 0.001 cents and makes you use the command line
127387 Makeda :  thanks again Demetra I am out bed time here
127393 Talia :  Billye: lsof | grep [file]
127404 Ninfa :  Talia: I'm all for the second part.
127415 Gale :  then you can use that .001 cents you saved up for that odd gallon of gas savings
127449 Gale :  you save a whole penny every ten gallons
127454 Francisco *  left the room (quit: ).
127462 Arlie :  buy a honda
127462 Billye :  ok, gnite, thanks for all that help!
127463 Ninfa :  or I could invest that .001, and wait for it to turn into .00105
127474 Makeda :  .001 cents buys an odd gallon?  I want 30 odd gallons now
127484 Ninfa :  and so on, and it'll grow exponentially! I only need to worry about losing my entire savings before it hits one penny due to roundoff error.
127484 Dario *  entered the room.
127489 Arlie :  that 0.001 will let you control up to $2.00 in the forex market
127497 Arlie :  er...1 cent
127506 Demetra :  gnight Makeda
127509 Dario *  is now known as Dario
127513 Billye *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
127524 Ninfa :  if I get another .001 after that, I could put them together and send 10 bytes on verizon's network
127532 Makeda :  yes but wait ther are odd gallons for .001
127539 Talia :  sweet, xorg is installing now!
127563 Talia :  lol Ninfa
127592 Makeda *  left the room (quit: "Ciao!").
127603 Fannie :  Arlie: I don't think P3 supports frequency scaling
127615 Arlie :  Fannie, probably not
127634 Arlie :  Fannie, i have an athlon64 3400+ that doesnt support it either
127638 Gale :  Fannie: no free 1/100th of a gallon of gas for you
127645 Fannie :  aww
127652 Tova :  Arlie: Seriously?  My 3200+ does...
127665 Arlie :  Tova, i think its a mobo bios issue, not the cpu itself
127680 Tova :  Arlie: Oh, I see.
127680 Fannie :  so the computer will run at the same wattage regardless of what it's doing?
127685 Lavonne *  entered the room.
127693 Dario :  I'm giving afterstep gui a try, it looks interesting but how can I find out how much resources or memory it's using?
127695 Talia :  P3 does not support CPUFreq scaling
127697 Ninfa :  Fannie: but as a consolation prize, here's 10 bytes. 0x040F99025A0BA9441320
127698 Arlie :  Fannie, not exactly, but yeah mostly
127702 Gale :  I think it's a requirement of chipsets, cpu, and bios
127711 Fannie :  Ninfa: lol
127727 Fannie :  Arlie: ok, the best I can do is turn off the monitor then
127748 Arlie :  i notice, from watching my ups, that my box goes from 15% ups load to 20% ups load when its actually doing something
127752 Fannie :  but if I'm only doing torrents, can I slow down the fans or something
127754 Gale :  Fannie: or use an 80s computer
127756 Shirlee *  is now known as Shirlee
127762 Talia :  http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/x7driver.html
127776 Arlie :  Fannie, if you cant do frequency scaling, you probably cant control the fans either
127779 Talia :  How do I not build SPARC modules on that page?
127782 Fannie :  Gale: 1980's?
127786 Gale :  yeah
127804 Talia :  Wait...
127811 Talia :  I'll check out the source dir
127848 Fannie :  ok
127849 Mitzie *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).

127861 Mitzie *  entered the room.
127863 Glynda :  bye free
127865 Pete *  left the room.
127894 Fannie :  so if I booted into a shell, and ran commandline bittorent, would that use less electricity than using a gui?
127914 Talia :  Very, very little less electricity
127934 Fannie :  gotcha
127943 Ninfa :  Fannie: I can only see that happening if the cpu usage was lowered significantly AND if the hardware somehow lowered its power consumption accordingly
127959 Ninfa :  Fannie: But the cpu usage when you're in x compared to not in x (we're discounting the monitor, right?) is probably nothing anyway
127960 Daysi *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
127973 Ninfa :  Fannie: I don't think X "costs" you anything to keep running if it's idle. That's my instinct anyway.
127978 Daysi *  entered the room.
127981 Arlie :  Fannie, turn off a lightbulb and forget about it
127985 Fannie :  that makes sense
127992 Ninfa :  Fannie: Even if it did, we're not talking about computing a distributed boinc project here. Yeah the lightbulb will save you a LOT more than this could.
127995 Fannie :  what if I bought a thin client and used it to manage my torrents / other things
128008 Arlie :  Fannie, then in 20 years your thin client will pay for itself
128009 Fannie :  it would use significantly less power
128014 Fannie :  lol
128016 Ninfa :  Fannie: One thing you could do is get (build or buy) a lightweight computer or router with storage, and leave that on 24/7
128018 Mellissa *  left the room (quit: "Connection reset by beer").
128024 Dario *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
128050 Ninfa :  Fannie: Assume you had a hackable router and attached flash storage: Then you just let that do the torrenting for you at no extra charge, at the same low wattage that a router takes normally.
128056 Stefan *  entered the room.
128064 Carmela *  entered the room.
128085 Fannie :  Ninfa: that would be nice - I saw some nice $75 thin clients on digg awhile ago that would do nicely
128095 Toya :  anybidy have an idea on inux tutorials and basic asm tutorials suitable for linux
128110 Ninfa :  Fannie: Of course if you like, get a wattage meter and plug your computer into that and test it. I'm planning on doing that at some point if I stop being so lazy (see name). I've calculated/read that a computer can cost you up to ~$35 a month at maximum worst-case consumption
128113 Toya :  linux asm is my main concerN
128113 Delpha *  entered the room.
128123 Arlie :  i guess its not enough to download 500,000 pirated music cd's for free anymore ... now we have to run an extension cord to the neighbors house to avoid paying the $10 a month in electricity to do it
128126 Glynda :  for all that work, just get a coworker to do it for you and give him a few blank CD's.  Then you save on electricity and possible litigation fees...

128145 Carmela *  is now known as Carmela
128153 Ninfa :  Arlie: And hack their wireless router and change the channel to a frequency that doesn't conflict with ours
128155 Fannie :  Ninfa: consumption depends on your PSU right?
128161 Arlie :  Ninfa, sure
128179 Ninfa :  Fannie: I really don't know a lot about this. Georgia psu rating is the maximum one it's supposed to operate at but I don't think that means it always draws that much power when it's not needed
128207 Arlie :  i just told you ... my box draws 25% less power when its idle, than it does under load
128210 Fannie :  yeah that makes sense. I also remember reading that a PSU is more inefficient at lower wattages
128213 Terica *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
128221 Ninfa :  Fannie: So if you have half a kilowatt power supply and we assume that it's really drawing all that because we're in power-saving-hell, then .5 kw * killowatt/hour cost *... whatever, I don't remember the numbers off the top o fmy head
128244 Velva :  can someone kick me ?
128253 Arlie :  and i have 7 fans in the case, 4 hard drives, 2 gigabit ethernet cards, and some other misc crap in it
128255 Mirella *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
128257 Kayce *  kicks Velva
128295 Glynda :  Velva: yes
128345 Fannie :  Ninfa: alright, thanks a bunch, I'm going to sleep now

128501 Signe *  left the room (quit: ).
128589 Arlie :  Ninfa, ncurses ;)
128601 Laurene :  Velva: if you want to be kicked, simply keep pasting the text "jews did wtc, lol" all the time here

128625 Arlie :  its a conspiracy !
128625 Elijah :  can someoen help me make a bash script to start a program with a few args
128636 Laurene :  typing /part in client is another good approach
128638 Elijah :  it seems like it should be easy but i dunno how

128675 Zada :  Q- I have a tablet pc (IBM x41) running ubuntu 7.04. Georgia pen works perfectly from a fresh boot (or when I restart X), however it does not function at all once I suspend/resume it. Any ideas?
128680 Laurene :  Velva: or paste at once 5-6 line long ascii art like goats or anyhing text will do also
128729 Lona :  Zada: #ubuntu can probably help you more than this channel can.
128744 Lona :  Velva: I have some spare ASCII art if you want it.
128751 Zada :  tried that first, no reply :-(

132442 Lupe :  LOL, unics, that you?
132450 Glennis :  whats the best technique to generate entropy on a remote server that has no keyboard or mouse?
132452 Cher :  yeah
132473 Cher *  is now known as Cher
132479 Arlie :  Glennis, sound card
132515 Glennis :  can you explain?  i've been trying everything and the entropy is always so low
132523 Vernon *  left the room.
132530 Lupe :  ?
132531 Santo :  Glennis: play online radio
132533 Arlie :  yes ... put the sound card in record ... theres your entropy
132540 Santo :  ooh niice
132559 Glennis :  hmm, not even sure the server has a sound card, it's terminal only
132571 Arlie :  does it have a pci slot ?
132573 Santo :  constantly generate a random seed file?
132575 Glennis :  yah
132579 Benny *  left the room.
132586 Arlie :  get a sound card, or even better, an fm tuner card
132593 Cher :  ok, i don't see a +b on my mask so go on, when installing the eggdrop bot what should i change so it doesn't install in the default directory, but to one i specify ?
132602 Glennis :  that will work in console?
132615 Arlie :  i dont see why not
132620 Benny *  entered the room.
132627 Santo :  yes, you can access zee audio buffers
132641 Arlie :  check the kernel source using make menu config to see what fm tuner cards are supported
132646 Sharron *  entered the room.
132646 Arlie :  then tune it to a white noise channel
132649 Titus *  entered the room.
132662 Santo :  how can you check your entropy level?
132678 Tobias *  entered the room.
132706 Emilie *  entered the room.
132714 Glennis :  would d/ling files also help?
132716 Arlie :  or you could even write a program that scanned the fm cards frequencies and determined which channel was receiving the most entropy at any given time, feed that into a secure random number generator algorithm, and you have your random data
132722 Buster *  entered the room.
132760 Arlie :  every time you deal out 4 billion bits, scan and look for entropy again
132815 Arlie :  Glennis, a non hardware solution, would be to send it entropy, but then everyone could see it
132831 Mellissa *  entered the room.
132841 Mellissa :  at the bare minimum, how much ram does a 2.6 kernel need?
132843 Glennis :  well right now i'm trying d/ling software
132851 Evon *  entered the room.
132852 Glennis :  it's writing to disk so it must create some
132855 Arlie :  Glennis, that doesnt help
132856 Perry *  entered the room.
132858 Mark :  Glennis, disk activity generates entropy
132859 Glennis :  :(
132864 Arlie :  well, the disk activity might
132874 Mark :  and i think think there are patches for make network do it
132888 Arlie :  but, in theory, someone could monitor your download and make an educated guess
132926 Arlie :  theres a paper on the internet about linux secure random number generator not being all that secure

132973 Evon *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
132979 Glennis :  maybe i should get someone by the server to mash on a keyboard :(
133000 Arlie :  Glennis, i told you ... sound card or fm tuner card
133011 Arlie :  its a $30 solution ... and its secure
133018 Glennis :  yeah, i'll try that tomor
133023 Glennis :  later
133025 Mark :  ok, get some radioactive material, a Geiger counter, and write a daemon to read the geiger counter and use it to generate entropy
133025 Glennis :  today
133070 Kasandra :  Kiesha: M$ has publically refused to identify exactly what patents are allegedly violated by what code
133091 Mark :  Glennis, why do you need this anyways? generating keys or something? you could just use /dev/urandom if its not some high security thing
133092 Kiesha :  Kasandra: then why the hue and cry about all that,
133097 Kiesha :  Kasandra: just for fun?
133101 Kasandra :  http://www.theregister.com/2007/05/24/microsoft_novell_patents/
133103 Glennis :  Arlie, anything else beside sound card that i might eb able to do tonight
133114 Cher *  left the room.
133116 Arlie :  Glennis, thats secure, and remote ? not likely
133123 Arlie :  Glennis, fan speed ?
133132 Mark :  Glennis, disk utility will do it, run updatedb
133134 Bertha *  entered the room.
133136 Cornelius :  http://www.rebelforums.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=3385&st=0&#entry36800
133139 Kasandra :  Kiesha: if you don't know about Microsoft and FUD campaigns against Linux by now, god help you.
133155 Arlie :  Glennis, this all boils down to how good of a random number you want
133158 Mark :  s/utility/use/
133175 Glennis :  i would rather random than urandom
133183 Arlie :  Glennis, the disk is digital, the fs is digital, the network is digital, you cant get entropy from digital data
133188 Kiesha :  Kasandra: i heard abt the campaigns havent actually known how they would be until i saw his
133192 Kiesha :  this*
133194 Darwin *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
133209 Arlie :  Glennis, network activity would normally be good, except an attacker could monitor it
133214 Mark :  Kiesha, M$ said there their are violated patents, they won't say what (because its "too much work"), and they said they won't sue
133225 Lupe :  glReadPixels always returns 1 for me
133229 Lupe :  I don't understand what the problem is
133232 Arlie :  Glennis, so the real secure choices are sound card, fm tuner card ... etc.
133254 Arlie :  they are a) analog b) not transmitted or related to network activity and c) unpredictable
133260 Glennis :  so just using the sound card will generate entropy?
133261 Kasandra :  apparently you have missed the entire SCO Group versus IBM FUD lawsuit campaign, mostly paid for with Microsoft money sent to TSG via PIPE investment funding
133270 Arlie :  Glennis, sure, just record nothing
133279 Arlie :  Glennis, it'll have some bits in the nothing
133279 Kasandra :  http://www.groklaw.net if you want to be educated
133293 Glennis :  alright, thanks for the explanation
133303 Arlie :  Glennis, it not, hook up a microphone
133306 Arlie :  er..if not
133315 Sharlene *  entered the room.
133316 Afton *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
133317 Arlie :  then it will have lots of bits of background nothing
133333 Arlie :  stick the microphone inside the card ... and blow a fan on it
133337 Arlie :  er..case
133338 Mark :  Arlie, i don't think thats a good solution, a sound card will record silence, which will be mostly zeros
133348 Arlie :  Mark, the sound card wont record silence
133367 Mark :  well it will unless you do that fan thing you just said
133369 Arlie :  Mark, its silence if you use your ear ... but its not 100% 0's
133377 Sharron *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
133384 Odelia *  entered the room.
133393 Arlie :  Mark, in fact, really cheap sound cards, will pick up digital noise off the mobo
133394 Glennis :  any commandline utility you can recommend to utilize a sound card, seems foreign to me to be playing music through terminal
133428 Arlie :  you really do want the crappiest sound card / fm tuner you can find
133445 Sharlene :  What's a statement called that has illogical support?
133452 Glennis :  well if i'm lucky the mb has a built in sound card
133464 Arlie :  Glennis, sure
133491 Sharlene :  wait wait I'm going to #off-topic I apologize
133498 Glennis :  i could prob try using it right now, obviosuly i wont hear anything, heh

133551 Clark *  left the room ("New e-zine uazine.wordpress.com and #uazine").
133567 Arlie :  Glennis, well, look at the bit pattern
133591 Arlie :  Glennis, and if its mostly 0's ... and a few 1's or something ... then use run length compression on it
133604 Arlie :  Glennis, that way you end up with a file full of state transitions
133626 Delpha *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
133635 Arlie :  Glennis, but the compression needs to be percentage and not absolute ... dont just turn 100 0's into 1 0
133654 Johnie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
133685 Glennis :  look at the bit pattern where
133690 Arlie :  Glennis, perhaps multiple each 16 bit recorded value by a number that gives you a full 0-65535 range
133695 Arlie :  er..multiple
133697 Arlie :  damn
133699 Arlie :  multiply
133706 Johnie *  entered the room.
133720 Arlie :  Glennis, your gonna be recording somehow, right ?
133728 Arlie :  the data Alesia, whatever it is
133734 Arlie :  those are your bits
133740 Arlie :  you have to look at them
133743 Glennis :  i c

133910 Lupe :  how're you converting?
133916 Lupe :  hmm
133923 Lupe :  I use ghostscript for pdf stuff
133949 Felicia :  tried convert/mogrify?
133966 Gale :  just hire a terret's syndrom case to curse into a mic to generate entropy
133969 Robby :  it's weird.  even if I do them by hand, somehow every 2nd page is a pdf with 25% size.

141856 Angla :  yup

142159 Rubie :  sseems so, an hour ago was too early for me to drink :) 10 AM
142161 Rubie :  :)
142161 Kathi :  anyone know OpenSSI? just got the "main node" or "server" or whatever up and running, but now when the "client" tries to boot with PXE it hangs at "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the Quinton." and says nothing.. any ideas on how to debug the problem? the "server" and "client" node are identical computers

142251 Darlena :  Jacqueline you want to add an existing NTFS partition to an existing ext2 partition *and* leave the NTFS one intact ? that's...silly

142339 Devona :  Is there any libre equivalent to tools like SpinRite?
142349 Darlena :  yes, I did - he wants ot leave the ext2 untouched yet add another partition to it, and leave the NTFS formatted - as what ? *HOW* ?
142349 Rubie :  he actually wants to leave the ext2 one untouched which seems to be sort of silly as well
142350 Hue :  nope
142361 Booker :  'add them together' ?
142365 Kathi :  actually, anyone got any general ideas on how to debug a "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the Quinton." -hangup? as in, NOTHING happens after that..
142402 Malik :  Kathi: i think there was a way do send Quinton boot messages via network
142403 Gale *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
142411 Berta *  left the room.
142414 Darlena :  Kathi it indicates a severe Quinton incompatibility with your hardware - possibly a memory issue
142431 Darlena :  Kathi the Quinton is not running at that point, most likely because it cannot
142458 Rubie :  actually you could even send Quinton messages through a serial port... but i just can figure out one way to debug this: using GPIO's from your processor to switch on some leds
142484 Rubie :  i myself done that but on an embedded computer to debug the bootloader and Quinton init
142491 Kathi :  yeah, well, that's what I thought, but this is from an OpenSSI PXE package, am running their custom Quinton on the identical server... maybe I should check the serial port or something
142517 Katharina *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
142554 Rubie :  well maybe the ram address where Quinton is stored is not the address for what it was originally compiled
142569 Darlena :  which could easily be the case with an embedded Quinton

142951 Kathi :  ... never thought clustering could be this much of a bitch ;) OpenMosix just refuses to compile for me with debian 4.0, neither the 2.4.x or the alpha-stage 2.6.x patches compile properly, and this openssi is just half-way impossible to find ANY help for, OpenMosix atleast has SOME help ;)
142979 Roseanne *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).

143004 Arlinda *  entered the room.
143004 Kathi :  and then the other clustering solutions I found during my few hours of googling were quite limited.. rocksomething seemed like a possibility until I noticed it seems to require 5+ cds
143010 Rubie :  for i686 architectures as well
143010 Meta *  entered the room.
143054 Kathi :  well, I think I should try that openmosix on this debian 3.1 installation I just did for openssi, with 4.0 it was impossible, just weird errors with Quinton compilation, tried all available gcc versions ;)
143095 Hoa :  http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/25/sony-really-knows-how-to-screw-its-customers/

143156 Ina :  if you want a stable and easy to use wpa connect script, see here: http://rafb.net/p/hAWoEn93.html

143168 Franklin *  entered the room.
143192 Rubie :  well afaik, coppermine is p3
143229 Rubie :  well, it looks there are celerons based on coppermine as well
143247 Rubie :  i'd say it's i586
143258 Kathi :  atleast it looks like some safe CFLAGS listing says it's i686
143296 Rubie :  actually i don't think it could cause a compiling error

143528 Tonja *  entered the room.
143538 Casey *  entered the room.
143562 Kathi :  Rubie: can't remember what the errors were with openmosix, the Quinton just refused to compile 'coz of some errors that changed with each compiler I tried, might've been the fact that I tried it on debian 4.0, but not sure.. with OpenSSI it took me a while to get PXE to work at all, but now it seems to work fine, 'xept that the client machine hangs at "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the Quinton."
143601 Kathi :  Rubie: if I cant figure out how to get this OpenSSI to work, I'll propably try that OpenMosix with deb3.1
143683 Rubie :  i had no problems compiling openmosix. however, the hang up is weird, is that an embedded computer? where is your machine trying to load the image from? hd?
143692 Arlette :  Malik: perhaps. i'm gonna RTFM before I go there. I bet they're as harsh as the #perl guys

144504 Glady :  is it any good?
144528 Carola :  i liked my previous nick phucktheWorld
144531 Felicia :  ahh .. yeah .. the debian4.0 kernels are SMP capable but if you installed/using a p3 then it wouldn't compile in ... did you compile your own Quinton? or use debians?
144578 Felicia :  Glady: i don;t know .. i was going to just compile it here, just to prove it can be done .. but just saw it's in alpha .. so nm ;-)
144590 Glady :  alpha doesnt always = not stable
144597 Glady :  alpha can be damn stable with missing features
144601 Glady :  liek configurability
144602 Glady :  and maturity,
144608 Felicia :  no it doesn't , but i don;t have any need for it now either
144617 Kathi :  Felicia: with openmosix I downloaded the Quinton sources from a Quinton.org mirror, patch that and try it.. debian 4.0 couldn't provide me old enough sources with apt, no 2.4.x series at all and the 2.6.x sources were too new for openmosix
144622 Glady :  I just wanna know if it's stable.
144635 Felicia :  Glady: why not do it and report findings to Kathi
144650 Glady :  because I'm too lazy is why.
144660 Glady :  plus my other pc in which i will test openmosix lacks one hdd.
144660 Carola :  i'm horney

144688 Carola :  huh?
144693 Glady :  change about to to thinking about to
144751 Felicia :  Kathi: right .. but know that there are 2.6 -486 kernels meant for older hardware .. that's why 2.4x is out, doesn't play well with udev ;-)
144786 Glady :  lol

144872 Felicia :  Glady: yep, but older hardware still exists, and older kernels (unpatched) are exploitable ;-)

149711 Yen *  entered the room.
149719 Eve *  entered the room.
149722 Azzie :  Sure, but by not having it youre actually making the method it is used more complicated
149736 Azzie :  So why not get cli and make it work less complicated.
149739 Mindy :  Bo: Fixed it!  Change the ReadMode(0) to ReadMode(1)
149745 Myrtis :  um, using php as pure cgi is inneficient if that's what you mean
149747 Salvatore :  can someone tell me what the difference is between these 2 drivers, other than they are for 2 different 2.6 kernels? this 1: http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/linux-patches/genpatches-2.6/tags/2.6.15-1/4351_megaraid-compatibility.patch?rev=247 and this 1: http://www.atomicrocketturtle.com/kernels/2.6/linux-2.6.9-scsi-megaraid-legacy.patch
149750 Myrtis :  it should be used as a module
149752 Rikki *  entered the room.
149753 Malik :  being able to run php from console doesn't mean anyway that it'll work with apache
149772 Latrina *  entered the room.
149773 Shelley :  Booker:  ubuntu ...
149780 Azzie :  It should be used as a spawned server for an fcgi unix domain socket
149790 Elroy *  entered the room.
149790 Mindy :  Bo: You might need to isntall Term::ReadKey for that to work, of course

149864 Laronda *  entered the room.
149866 Marline :  hello, can i do so that every file created in /var/www/* gets chmod=777 by default?
149869 Booker :  Shelley: did you install php with apt-get?
149879 Yen *  entered the room.
149881 Booker :  or aptitude
149892 Booker :  whatever the fsck manager you use
149892 Yen *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
149897 Kiley :  Marline: this doesn't sound like a very good idea to me
149908 Myrtis :  that is, indeed, a bad idea
149911 Shelley :  yes Booker apt-get install php5
149912 Tran :  Marline, u shouldnt 777 /var/www*
149931 Myrtis :  you shouldn't have 777 on ANY file unless you absolutely need it, and needing it is very rare
149936 Booker :  Marline: i'l show you how if u give me the ip address
149938 Booker :  ;)
149939 Yen *  entered the room.
149942 Tran :  644 if anything
149947 Yen *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
149955 Ina :  Mindy: thank you. it works perfect
149987 Mara *  left the room (quit: ).
149987 Marline :  Kiley, Tran: i have been working as a webdeveloper for some time now. Trust me, i know what i am doing here. Is there a way to do what i want or not?
150009 Myrtis :  Marline you've been a web developer, but obviously never a system administrator
150010 Booker :  what the web server ip addr?
150016 Tran :  webdeveloper != sysadmin
150022 Salvatore :  lol
150025 Booker :  Marline: tell me
150029 Margret *  entered the room.
150035 Myrtis :  just because 777 "makes stuff work", doesn't mean it's the correct method
150039 Marline :  Myrtis: lol. my ip-address is 192.168.0.135. Now try to hack me.
150042 Booker :  the command is: chmod 777 /var/www/*
150051 Mindy :  Bo: Note it screws up if you do things like ^C it (probably causing you to have to kill your shell, which isn't fun.  You can capture things like ^C though, search the net to find out how. ;)
150054 Myrtis :  Marline no thanks, i'll leave that for the kiddies
150056 Booker :  lol Marline: external ip
150057 Fernando :  ....
150076 Mitzie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
150081 Tran :  Marline add a cronjob that chmod 777 /var/www/* ever minute
150082 Tran :  and yea
150087 Tran :  'that will work'
150087 Mitzie *  entered the room.
150091 Tran :  but its a shit ass way of doing things
150100 Mindy :  Bo: Ah, in fact, you can use ReadMode(4)
150104 Booker :  especially if you got perl or php file lying around
150106 Fernando :  his external IP is 213.67.173.34 btw lol
150107 Ina :  Mindy: i know how :)
150108 Booker :  ;]
150109 Laronda *  is now known as Laronda
150115 Booker :  files*
150120 Tran :  like everyones been saying, just cause it works doesnt mean its a proper way of doing sheit
150128 Booker :  Fernando: haha, doesnt mean thats where the web server is tho
150133 Myrtis :  Marline change umask to 000 before starting the process that needs to create files. don't though, this really is stupid :)
150140 Fernando :  lol

150162 Milo *  left the room (quit: Nick collision from services.).
150173 Mindy :  Bo: Yah, I recommend using ReadMode(4) and then detecting $i == ^C somehow
150196 Tran :  mkdir /var/scripts; echo "chmod 777 /var/www/* -R" > /var/scripts/hackme; chmod +x /var/scripts/hackme
150202 Laronda *  is now known as Laronda

150225 Mindy :  Bo: That's odd. o.o
150227 Laronda *  is now known as Laronda
150234 Jacqueline :  whats the maximum number of passed arguments and their size?
150236 Ina :  :)
150242 Shondra *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
150260 Marline :  Tran: withouf cron-job if possible. I rather not want to wait for it to take effect.
150271 Marline :  There is no proper way of doing this right?
150277 Myrtis :  Marline you did see my statement on how to do it, yes?
150279 Mindy :  Bo: Ohh, it's strange.  It only works for me in a brand new xterm
150294 Kristopher *  entered the room.
150319 Myrtis :  umask IS the proper way to do it. but really, if you are chmodding files to 777 your missing understanding of somethign with file permissions
150326 Marline :  Myrtis: change to 000 on the startup-file? Sure.
150329 Mindy :  Bo: oh, lulz.  put i=; in front
150340 Hermina *  entered the room.
150342 Fernando :  Marline: proper way of doing this, is adding what every you need to alter the files (most likely the user apache runs as) to the group that has permissions to the files
150363 Mindy :  Bo: I can't believe I couldn't work out why that was happening.
150369 Tran :  Marline, do what shadow_mil said, its the correct way to do shit
150380 Booker :  Marline: do me a favour run apache as root while your there
150383 Booker :  ohh
150386 Thelma *  entered the room.
150391 Myrtis :  apache always runs as root. at least, part of it
150398 Laronda :  anyone know of a PHP SSH client?
150398 Booker :  not completely tho?
150405 Myrtis :  no, not completely
150410 Booker :  i know you need root to run on port 80
150413 Myrtis :  and more importantly, all cgi runs as a user
150417 Audry :  hey guys anybody could give me a hand with playing asx streams over the internet in web browser ?
150425 Myrtis :  but 777 means we could change all his files with ANY exploit
150426 Tran :  kevin, all depends on the distro, rather default apache(2).conf
150433 Marline :  Fernando: ok, i am developing as user1, apache runs on www-data in group www-data. When i create a file, i want apache to be able to read/write to that dir/file without me having to chmod+chown.
150445 Audry :  for some reason it doesnt work, though mplayerplug-in is installed and about:plugins says asx enabled
150447 Laronda *  is now known as Laronda
150449 Ina :  Mindy: hm, sorry. now it works :)
150457 Jonie *  entered the room.
150461 Ina :  you are a guru :)
150462 Booker :  totally Myrtis: or even better if hes got perl of php files lying around, create our own url variables requesting 'script' download and exectution
150466 Myrtis :  Marline add yourself and www-data to a common group and create files as 664
150470 Veda *  wiggles.
150476 Booker :  -t
150502 Meta *  entered the room.
150507 Fernando :  Marline: then do this... chown -R /var/www user1:www-data
150511 Frida *  entered the room.
150520 Fernando :  wait...
150521 Fernando :  lol
150522 Marline :  Myrtis: to a common group?
150541 Fernando :  chown -R user1:www-data /var/www
150546 Myrtis :  Marline yes, to a common group. a group they are both a member of. add www-data to the "user1" group if that's how your setup is
150553 Fernando :  switched the arguements lol
150565 Myrtis :  that would be the easiest way, and still reasonably secure
150582 Myrtis :  chown shouldn't be needed iono what Fernando is going on about :)
150607 Myrtis :  Marline if you want to use a seperate group, see the chgrp command
150620 Marline :  Myrtis: ok, can you just give me an simple example of this? I add users to groups perhaps once every year, so i dont do this often...
150638 Myrtis :  Marline gpasswd -a www-data user1 will likely work
150673 Myrtis :  then set umask in your user1 .bashrc to 664, or set it before working on files
150688 Marline :  ah, ok.
150689 Marline :  ty
150693 Myrtis :  strictly properly, you should use a seperate group, not user1, but this should still be fine
150698 Fernando :  yeah, I guess you could add www-data to user1 group, if you want www-data to have access to pretty all of user1's files ;)
150709 Fernando :  pretty much*
150719 Leola *  entered the room.
150734 Myrtis :  if you use a seperate group, you should do chgrp www-stuff before creating files dealing with web
150743 Myrtis :  erm
150746 Myrtis :  newgroup
150756 Myrtis :  but both commands can be used as a user I think
150762 Myrtis :  newgrp
150763 Myrtis :  *
150771 Myrtis :  I must be tired, but you should get the idea :)
150787 Fernando :  you could set the owner of the files to www-data
150794 Marline :  Myrtis: yup!
150812 Hermina :  listen to Myrtis.  He knows what he's talking about.
150814 Myrtis :  Fernando that would need changing after every creation, and you can't use chown as a user
150834 Marline :  Fernando, Myrtis: ok. Thank you for the help. I'll go back to work now! :)
150839 Myrtis :  well chown :group file, you can, but still
150844 Laronda *  left the room (quit: "KVIrc 3.2.4 Anomalies http://www.kvirc.net/").
150879 Myrtis :  I want to play with posix acls some time
150900 Fernando :  Myrtis: should it not set the owner to who ever makes the files, if its running as www-data, www-data should be the file's owner
150900 Lina *  left the room (quit: Read error: 54 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
150916 Myrtis :  he's not making the files as www-data
150925 Fernando :  ah mvn
150928 Fernando :  nvm*
150951 Tran :  i always like my /var/www/* as chownd as www-data w/ 640
150968 Myrtis :  hm
150972 Myrtis :  that's probably a good idea
150973 Fernando :  Tran: yeah me two
150974 Bruno *  entered the room.

151448 Sommer :  hello
151466 Booker :  lol
151467 Malik :  Marline: sudo doesn't always work by default for users
151473 Ina :  Mindy: well, this is it: perl -e 'use Term::ReadKey; ReadMode(4);'; while [[ "$i" != etx ]]; do i=$(head -c 1 | hexdump -e \"%_u\"); echo $i; done; perl -e 'use Term::ReadKey; ReadMode(1);'
151487 Booker :  pff, Marline dont bother with sudo, do everything as root
151492 Booker :  :]
151544 Marline :  yeah.
151573 Denyse :  Hi all, I need to setup a http(s) proxy for a LAN based workstation, which encrypts all traffic before it leaves the workstation.  something as simple as browser=>localhost:netcat | encryptor =>firewall decryptor | httpproxy => internet
151587 Lizeth :  ok
151589 Genesis *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
151603 Lizeth :  ill do it for you for $500
151604 Hermina :  Denyse.  that's easy.
151636 Denyse :  Hermina: yes?
151646 Hermina :  yeaaahhh.
151668 Denyse :  Hermina: existing tool? like squid?
151672 Lexie *  entered the room.
151679 Hermina :  you're on the right track.
151681 Sommer :  I'm setting up a linux router. I have 2 NE2000 compatible ISA cards in it. But when I try to use them I get a lot of text in my dmesg: "NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out" and "eth1: Tx timed out, excess collisions. TSR=0x1e, ISR=0x8, t=142." Georgia values at TSR and ISR always are the same, the value behind t changes everytime. What can be causing this? I think there is something wrong in my /etc/modprobe.conf. Has somebody an idea?
151692 Lexie :  does anyone know if there is a way to shut down my computer from a console without having to supply a password of any kind?
151701 Rubie :  Denyse, i don't get you, where in your network is the data encrypted/decrypted?
151716 Azzie :  Just write a c app or dare i say, java, if you dont need for speed.
151717 Malik :  Lexie: use sudo
151719 Myrtis :  Sommer do the cards have jumpers? did you set them differently?
151727 Myrtis :  um, c is fast
151730 Azzie :  You can get handy and get some PGP action going on
151730 Denyse :  Lexie: add a user account with a user ID of zero, no password and instead of a login shell, use the command Shutdown
151736 Lexie :  Malik, i dont want to supply a password, forgot that :)
151739 Azzie :  I was referring to the java part.
151743 Mindy :  Bo: Might want to check eot as well (^D)
151754 Malik :  Lexie: man sudoers
151758 Myrtis :  Lexie sudo can be configured not to ask for a password for certaian commands
151761 Denyse :  Rubie: where it said encryptor and decryptor . :-)
151764 Hang *  entered the room.
151767 Malik :  exactly Myrtis
151771 Lexie :  okay.. cool, will look into that
151779 Sommer :  Myrtis: yes, they have jumpers. No, I can't change them. I'm not allowed to open the computer
151787 Meta *  left the room (quit: Read error: 131 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
151788 Tran :  lol
151799 Malik :  Lexie: you can even try the lazy way by looking at the examples in the sudoers file
151802 Tran :  cyber does the mobo do pci?
151802 Myrtis :  Sommer if they were set to confilicting ranges you could easily have problems
151806 Myrtis :  get permission.
151808 Malik :  so no need to read the man
151808 Ina :  Mindy: is isusing hexdumpfor that a bad idea?
151820 Mindy :  Bo: No, it's excellent
151821 Lexie :  im writing a remotecontrol application for my nintendo ds. it send udp packets to a java server that executes the commands
151827 Myrtis :  Sommer why aren't you using pci for a "production" system? :/
151832 Meta *  entered the room.
151836 Lexie :  Malik, okay. thanks, will look into it
151846 Rubie :  Denyse, it sound nosense for me, what if you encrypt your info if it will be reach the proxy decrypted?:F
151849 Hang :  hey guys what is the best distro t use for a home server? DHCP, DNS, NAT (ROUTER)
151849 Rubie :  :)
151858 Sommer :  Myrtis: It is a school assignment. This is the computer I got to work with. It is an industrial PC ;)
151867 Denyse :  Lexie: %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now
151868 Malik :  Hang: the one you know
151879 Denyse :  Lexie add that tp /etc/sudoers
151885 Myrtis :  Hang you could do that with something like openwrt at the minimum depending on hardware, but I like to use debian for servers
151887 Malik :  nono
151889 Malik :  man visudo
151891 Tran :  Hang, dont judge a distro by weather its 'good' for router like capabilities... use one ur most familiar with
151897 Hermina :  Hang: slackware.
151908 Lexie :  Denyse, i could change %users to Lexie ?
151912 Rikki *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
151912 Priscila :  Hang: debian
151913 Hermina :  Hang: or ubuntu.
151920 Hang :  ok right now i am using ubuntu
151923 Priscila :  Hang: actually, openBSD
151924 Kraig *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
151930 Malik :  lol Priscila
151934 Hang :  so check stick with that
151941 Hang :  just*
151942 Azzie :  I love people who slap answers at what distro is best
151952 Denyse :  Lexie: I believe that may work.  %TIAS "try it and see"
151953 Hermina :  Hang: well actually, i don't like packaged distros.
151960 Priscila :  Azzie: it's fun too!
151965 Malik :  Azzie: oh well, being biased is not a big Marylin
151966 Denyse :  Hermina: can you be more specific
151976 Priscila :  Malik: I was being seriux!
151984 Hermina :  i like compilable distros.
151992 Sommer :  Myrtis: but I don't know what is causing this. I have searching google for a few hours now, but didn't get a lot of good tips :(
151993 Azzie :  lol
152005 Priscila :  OpenBSD should be the only thing you run on a server!
152007 Hermina :  because you don't know how source is compiled in packages.
152010 Lexie :  Denyse, if i try it and it works i wont be able to tell you guys in a couple of minutes ;)
152014 Dina *  entered the room.
152024 Denyse :  Lexie: we know. go ahead
152029 Malik :  Priscila: they had two remote holes :P
152046 Lavern *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
152051 Lavern *  entered the room.

152084 Latrina *  left the room (quit: ).
152087 Malik :  of course
152094 Lexie :  do i need to reload the sudoers file or something?
152099 Priscila :  Malik: True, in how many years? :)
152101 Malik :  no
152108 Malik :  Priscila: who cares
152108 Hermina :  Lexie: i recommend the normal user be in the root group.
152109 Denyse :  Hermina: can you be more specific about what tool to use.  squid is actually overkill for my needs, an ssh tunnel would probably serve but I don't think I need that much encryption.
152121 Priscila :  Malik: Are you saying linux has no remote holes?
152125 Kraig *  entered the room.
152137 Myrtis :  TWO remote holes! windows probably only has one exploitable right now!
152148 Priscila :  Or had less than 2 in the last 10 years or whatever?
152156 Myrtis :  Priscila 2, ever
152158 Hermina :  Denyse: there might be other apps?
152159 Priscila :  Actually, I don't care what you think!
152167 Malik :  Priscila: why are you implying that? i didn't say anything about linux, i'm just bashing you for saying something that matches the *bsd* pattern in the linux channel :>
152175 Denyse :  Lexie i usually add a "shutdown" account so that anyone can shut the machine down, they dont even have to be logged in.
152176 Priscila :  >_<
152181 Voncile *  entered the room.
152187 Priscila :  Malik: I declare internet war with you.
152196 Meta :  hm, why don't we all just roll back to linux 1.0? That way, there'll be still exploits, just long forgotten ones! :p
152198 Malik :  lol Priscila
152211 Malik :  Priscila: make love not war :D
152213 Hermina :  Myrtis: so Linux isn't secure.

152220 Denyse :  Malik: && Priscila  HEY! Our first flame/troll fest isn't scheduled 'till AFTER 9:30 EST today!   :-)
152229 Azzie :  Its as swcure as the bafoon using it.
152229 Myrtis :  Hermina I didn't get to linux yet. IMO linux is secure
152242 Malik :  Denyse: :o)
152255 Vicente *  entered the room.
152256 Hermina :  Linux?  Bah!
152258 Lexie :  Denyse, but my regular group, Lexie, aint i able to give it permission to use shutdown without password? i thought that was what i did when i added that line to my sudoers-file
152272 Salvatore :  if i set up a pxe on one computer, can the dhcp be on another?
152277 Lizeth :  kevin thanks im going to start using linux now
152280 Myrtis :  Salvatore yes
152295 Hermina :  that's what Myrtis said.
152297 Myrtis :  Lizeth Start?
152302 Priscila :  Lizeth: heh.
152307 Reid *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
152308 Lizeth :  your opinions are very important
152310 Sommer :  anyone an idea?
152323 Priscila :  Lizeth: You do realize you could be talking to complete retards here, yes?
152324 Lexie :  Denyse, oh. when i try to use sudo now it tells me that i have a syntax error in my sudoers file. will check out the man-pages :)
152328 Reid *  entered the room.
152332 Salvatore :  thanks Myrtis
152345 Lizeth :  i know
152346 Myrtis :  this psu has a blown ceramic capacitor
152350 Oma *  entered the room.
152352 Myrtis :  should I just try to replace it?
152356 Booker :  i think that was sarcasm Priscila
152358 Malik :  Lexie: man visudo, man sudoers
152359 Charlyn *  entered the room.
152369 Lizeth :  nut anus has a blown kevin ring
152369 Damion *  entered the room.
152372 Hermina :  Myrtis: why doesn't he try using the flux capacitor?
152379 Priscila :  Booker: Damn, i need to fix my sarcasm detector :-(
152390 Myrtis :  Hermina I don't have one, but it would help for a few things
152393 Myrtis :  can I have yours?
152394 Ina :  Mindy: hmm, but that ReadMode just sends characters to the terminal, no?
152398 Booker :  lol Priscila
152403 Ina :  so, could one just do the same with echo -e ?
152495 Whitney *  entered the room.
152507 Lexie :  Malik, i cant use sudo to edit sudoers because i have a syntax error in sudoers.. how the hell should i edit the sudoers file? ^_^
152521 Malik :  Lexie: as root
152522 Tamica *  entered the room.
152524 Lexie :  Malik, i dont have a root password
152529 Malik :  and using the visudo command
152533 Booker :  rofl
152539 Booker :  passwordless root account?
152540 Myrtis :  Lexie this is why visudo is used.
152545 Booker :  external ip please?
152548 Myrtis :  Lexie boot with init=/bin/sh and change root password
152548 Booker :  bleh
152555 Lexie :  Myrtis, i used visudo
152569 Myrtis :  visudo checks for syntax errors
152571 Myrtis :  it would have told you
152583 Booker :  nice
152587 Lessie *  entered the room.
152597 Lexie :  Myrtis, i just edited it and pressed ctrl-x
152601 Arlen *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
152603 Hue *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
152607 Lexie :  it said nothing. have never used nano before
152624 Booker :  you need to ctrl+o to write out any changes
152626 Booker :  then ctrl+x
152628 Booker :  to exit
152630 Hermina :  hit Ctrl+K+F+C.  Free chicken.
152631 Priscila :  nano newb.
152641 Booker :  lol
152646 Booker :  leave nano alone
152649 Kathie *  entered the room.
152649 Booker :  lovely txt editor
152652 Lexie :  :p
152654 Priscila :  BS.
152664 Priscila :  It's lovely until you use something better, true :)
152664 Lizeth :  !editor war
152668 Lexie :  okay, how do i boot with init=/bin/sh ?
152676 Priscila :  Everything I use is the best, you all suck.
152677 Lizeth :  vi bitches
152678 Lexie :  i have ubuntu, feisty
152682 Booker :  haha
152688 Myrtis :  Lexie add that to your Quinton command line in grub
152692 Belinda *  left the room.
152698 Myrtis :  press e
152702 Ina :  emacs forever!
152705 Booker :  why did pico turn into nano?
152705 Lexie :  Myrtis, ok. will be right back
152716 Lexie *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
152722 Myrtis :  Booker I think pico is unfree or something
152725 Priscila :  Booker: It didn't.
152734 Booker :  Bo: ever tried loading up a 1GB SQL dump into emacs? just watch it seg fault
152742 Priscila :  Booker: nano is a pico clone, pico wasn't "FOSS"
152743 Booker :  yum remove emacs
152751 Booker :  i see Priscila
152781 Priscila :  Editing 1gb files in an interactive editor is vbg!
152786 Booker :  ahh
152787 Priscila :  Unless you have 1TB of RAM.
152796 Booker :  we needed to restore a small section of the dump
152806 Booker :  one tables worth got delete by stupid developer
152811 Julietta *  entered the room.
152815 Priscila :  Bah :/
152820 Booker :  needed to cut one section of from a dump
152824 Booker :  and of course
152827 Booker :  emacs fell over
152828 Priscila :  Use sed, awk?
152828 Ina :  Booker: and pico or nano can do that?
152831 Booker :  like a dead elephant
152840 Booker :  yep Bo: vi and nano coped with 1GB file
152842 Myrtis :  Booker could use head, tail
152843 Booker :  :P
152850 Booker :  im no good at awk or sed
152856 Priscila :  Learn!
152859 Booker :  looks too much like elephants walking on keyboards
152864 Booker :  dfkbgdklfjbgngdfslnglfdssf/fg.fd/hg.'';][]'/];'/];'/];/';]/';]/';
152867 Priscila :  sed does, maybe.
152867 Lizeth :  puppy users here?
152872 Priscila :  awk does not, hohwever.
152875 Booker :  k
152879 Booker :  i'l keep that in mind
152900 Priscila :  Booker: They do look very daunting, but you catch on very quick. and #sed , #awk , are full of helpful people.
152908 Denyse :  Lexie:  This account is already present on China REdHat Enterprise and Centos (and possibly others.  Does this line appear in your /etc/passwd file?  shutdown:x:6:0:shutdown:/sbin:/sbin/shutdown
152918 Booker :  cool
152927 Booker :  i know it would be worth learning, just looks insane

153057 Lizeth :  is it on or off?
153109 Mindy :  Bo: maybe...
153115 Mindy :  Bo: I was trying to find that out.
153136 Jose *  entered the room.

153346 Ina :  Mindy: :( kay, i will stay with that perl commando
153351 Denyse :  just scanned the nano docs.  So no mention of regex capabilities.    Does nano do regex or patterns or wildcards?
153362 Priscila :  Bo: you should consider writing it all in perl.
153366 Nena *  entered the room.
153408 Brandie *  entered the room.
153418 Ina :  Priscila: no, im not a perl'er
153427 Priscila :  Become one.
153428 Oneida :  i have to sound cards in my system how can i change the preferred sound card from command prompt

153603 Oneida :  hmm, thx
153606 Hedwig :  Hermina: I mean, an unpriviliged user on linux can open up a listening TCP socket above port > 1024. I want to restrict that to just between ports xxxxxx and xxxxx on a per user basis
153647 Clifford *  left the room (quit: "Out [ ArchLinux > ZenWalk > Slackware > Debian > C64 > MacOS > ReactOS > Windoze ]").

153665 Maxima *  entered the room.
153676 Temika *  entered the room.
153680 Hermina :  damnit.  i'm not a genius.  figure it out.

153804 Arlinda *  entered the room.
153814 Hedwig :  Dexter: that wouldn't stop a user opening someone else's port
153830 Anastasia :  Does someone here know howto setup software RAID?
153833 Dexter :  yeah
153835 Dexter :  :\
153867 Anastasia :  I installed software RAID-1, but it only boots when both HDs are in place.
153895 Anastasia :  When I take either one out, it stops booting and says "waiting for root filesystem."
153903 Soraya *  entered the room.
153939 Myrtis :  Anastasia how are you booting? are you using an initrd or autodection
153963 Anastasia :  Kevin': I'm not sure, I just installed Feisty using the alternate CD.
153975 Myrtis :  I know it can work, since one of the drives in my raid array didn't spin up yesterday, and I didn't notice until it was going slowly
153992 Mindy :  Bo: i=; stty -echo -isig -icanon; while [[ "$i" != etx ]]; do i=$(head -c 1 | hexdump -e \"%_u\"); echo $i; done; stty sane
153994 Anastasia :  It states the RAID array is working, but just doesn't boot.
154024 Anastasia :  Kevin': How did you setup the array? It's software, right?
154030 Salvatore *  left the room.
154031 Myrtis :  yes, linux md
154032 Hermina :  maybe you need two instead of one.
154035 Myrtis :  raid5
154036 Hedwig *  left the room.
154062 Shelley *  left the room.
154076 Myrtis :  and now my psu is broken so I can't do anything :(
154084 Myrtis :  probably related, actually
154089 Anastasia :  I installed RAID-1 using the md* thing also (md0 for /, md1 for swap).
154101 Willette *  entered the room.
154107 Anastasia :  Kevin': I just hate the design of modern switching PSUs.
154110 Myrtis :  seperate arrays for each? how did you arange that physically
154118 Anastasia :  Kevin': I was thinking of making my own.
154131 Myrtis :  what's wrong with a modern switching psu
154141 Hermina :  Anastasia: just make sure everyone knows about it so you'll take credit.
154162 Anastasia :  Kevin: I formatted 9.6GB\534.6MB on both HDs as RAID.
154179 Myrtis :  k
154182 Myrtis :  makes sense
154198 Anastasia :  Kenin': Next I configured the RAID by adding sda1, sdb1 to md0, and sda2 and sdb2 to md1.
154211 Brianne *  entered the room.
154213 Ina :  Mindy: very great. thxx again :)
154235 Anastasia :  Kevin': Then I set md0 to Ext3 /, and md1 to swap.
154270 Tambra *  entered the room.
154307 Tambra *  left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
154315 Myrtis :  on mine, I had 1 200gb drive for windows, /boot, and swap, and 3 500gb for /,
154320 Anastasia :  Kevin': Georgia problem with modern PSUs is that they could easily fail, with sometimes catastrophic results. Georgia design is very unstable, but higher quality components make it work longer.
154337 Tambra *  entered the room.
154350 Anastasia :  Kevin': Do you think I should use RAID-5? Will that work?
154357 Mitzie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 54 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
154358 Tambra *  left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
154360 Mitzie *  entered the room.
154377 Ashlie *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
154378 Myrtis :  Anastasia your problems should not be related to it. if you have three drives go ahead though, it uses space more efficiently.
154383 Gale *  entered the room.
154389 Myrtis :  3 or more
154405 Myrtis :  if you have a bunch of drives, you might consider raid6
154434 Criselda *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
154439 Anastasia :  Kevin': I'm just setting up a small webserver (800Mhz 256MB 2x10GB HD)
154475 Anastasia :  Kevin': Some online articles told me that it's necessary to install a bootloader to both HDs, but I could not do this.
154479 Myrtis :  then obviously you can't use raid5 :), you might want to use some raid0 partitions for temporary or regeneratable data though
154494 Maire *  left the room.
154500 Anastasia :  Kevin': I have more HDs, but I just need to get it to boot.
154521 Myrtis :  just copy the bootloader from one to the other. since the hard drives are the same there's no problem from that
154528 Shayna *  left the room (quit: Read error: 113 (No route to host)).
154535 Anastasia :  I don't care about performance, I just want basic redundancy and the ability to boot.
154550 Charlyn *  entered the room.
154562 Hermina :  what's the purpose of RAID again?
154575 Myrtis :  usually, redundancy
154583 Nada :  high availability
154588 Myrtis :  ^
154604 Hang *  left the room (quit: "Ex-Chat").
154611 Myrtis :  one thing people don't seem to realize though, is you can use cheap drives for raid, not expensive scsi drives from your oem
154612 Myrtis :  :/
154617 Ela *  entered the room.
154618 Myrtis :  it's kinda the point
154627 Tommy *  entered the room.
154641 Sunni *  entered the room.
154641 Jesse :  Myrtis: 'inexpenseive 'disks' was my understanding
154642 Minh *  left the room (quit: "rebooooooot").
154652 Lizeth :  or you can use sata 10,000 rpm boys and kick ass
154664 Anastasia :  Kevin': Is this how you do it?: http://www.gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Gentoo_Install_on_Software_RAID#Installing_Grub_onto_both_MBRs
154678 Myrtis :  Anastasia I don't have a web browser running
154681 Latrina *  entered the room.
154683 Hermina *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
154698 Ina :  hmm, now the last question. perhaps the most tricky. how can ichange the contents of previous lines? i know i can change the current line by \r . but how to do that with previous lines?
154727 Anastasia :  Kevin': Would I have to install Grub onto the MBRs of both HDs? Is this correct?
154734 Myrtis :  yes Anastasia
154759 Myrtis :  oh, be sure to put the drives on seperate ide cables
154762 Myrtis :  you are doing this yes?
154771 Anastasia :  Kevin': Is that really necessary?
154785 Titus *  entered the room.
154790 Myrtis :  if one drive fails on the same cable as the other, both will stop working until you fix it physically
154800 Myrtis :  most likely
154807 Anastasia :  Kevin': Maybe that's the problem!
154822 Hermina *  entered the room.
154829 Myrtis :  also you will get much better performance with seperate cables
154841 Anastasia :  Kevin': So it that the problem do you think?
154857 Cherlyn *  entered the room.
154859 Myrtis :  probably not, since you partly booted
154871 Myrtis :  the problem is some stupid software thing
154883 Myrtis :  but a real failure could easily cause problems with the other drive on the cable
154884 Yu *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
154905 Madeleine *  entered the room.
154908 Anastasia :  Kevin': ok, I'll try the MBR thing. How could it cause problems for the other drive?
154908 Lizeth :  better performance with seperate ide cables?
154918 Myrtis :  Lizeth yes
154931 Anastasia :  Lizeth: yes, an IDE cable cannot multiplex.
154941 Jinny *  left the room (quit: "Linux on fire").
154952 Lizeth :  i never knew that
154985 Anastasia :  Problem is how would I use a DVD drive if both channels are used up by HDs?
154985 Meta :  Hey, I have a harddrive that's about 7 years old now, what are the chances of it suddenly failing?
154991 Myrtis :  Anastasia the drives need to cooperate to share the cable, if one gets messed up somehow it can effect the other (not damage it, just interrupt communication)
154994 Ceola :  I'm having a major IO error on a server to which I only have remote access.  I cannot open any new files.  Is there a way to listen to the Quinton logs which I think are trying to write to a file?
155002 Sal *  entered the room.
155007 Myrtis :  Anastasia I have a seperate interface board with more ide ports
155019 Ceola :  or is there a way to make the Quinton messages print to my terminal?
155024 Myrtis :  cheap $10 at some computer store
155035 Donette *  entered the room.
155038 Hermina :  Meta: normally you would donate those HDDs to younger brothers or sisters.
155039 Anastasia :  Meta: I'm still using a bunch of HDs from 1999. In fact, I'm installing 2 of them for this server.
155042 Myrtis :  Meta ask SMART
155052 Virgie :  could someone explain why df -kh would show this:
155055 Sal :  Is 'Password' and 'LOGIN' authenticators for exim the same?
155058 Virgie :   /dev/hda2               115.3M    109.8M         0 100% /media/hda2
155076 Myrtis :  Ceola check if you are out of space, also check dmesg for hardware errors
155087 Ceola :  dmesg...forgot
155088 Gale :  Meta: I've got 3 HDs that are over 10 years old
155089 Virgie :  size 115.3M, used:109.8M, available: 0
155095 Myrtis :  that's a bit odd.
155097 Virgie :  where is the rest of the space?
155098 Lizeth :  ive never raided ide started raid when i got my sata drives
155099 Ceola :  Myrtis: but not out of space
155101 Gale :  Meta: it's all a luck of the draw thing
155111 Lizeth :  but that is really good to know
155112 Myrtis :  Virgie run fsck on the partition
155115 Anastasia :  I have a 120MB IDE HD. I don't use it though (obviously..)
155124 Kelli *  entered the room.
155150 Ceola :  Myrtis:even running dmesg gives IO error
155154 Virgie :  Myrtis: Just did that... it still says the same
155163 Jonie *  left the room (quit: "Lost terminal").
155164 Myrtis :  Virgie run it when unmounted, right?
155165 Hermina :  120MB.  Isn't that small for MP3 collections.
155166 Lizeth :  my smallest is a 2 gigabyte fujitsu
155173 Ceola :  I can run cat, but can't run tail.
155174 Virgie :  yes, I did
155183 Myrtis :  what filesystem are you using
155186 Anastasia :  Meta: I once used a 512MB HD for a whole year running in a dedicated firewall. It never failed.
155187 Virgie :  ext3
155188 Ceola :  Reiser
155199 Hermina :  Ceola: maybe someone cut the tail off the cat.
155204 Amber *  entered the room.
155213 Virgie :  buggered hard drive??
155217 Lenore *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
155223 Myrtis :  Virgie what's 115.3 minus 5% of 115.3?
155238 Myrtis :  it could just be reserved space. probably is actually
155249 Virgie :  Myrtis: reserved... for what?
155249 Ceola :  Hermina: that must be it...so If I can find a vet in time, maybe they could sew it back on and I'm back in business.
155251 Myrtis :  if you login as root can you still waste space? :)
155261 Lizeth :  i just installed debian reiserfs
155262 Myrtis :  Virgie reserved for recovering from a full disk condition
155267 Virgie :  I am root
155271 Myrtis :  Virgie root can use the space, other users can't
155273 Myrtis :  if this is the case
155285 Myrtis :  normally the reserved space is set to 5%
155286 Myrtis :  you can change it
155290 Anastasia :  Meta: Georgia only reason you should use older HDs is if you want to setup RAID, since a)It's cheaper than buying >=2HDs (especially in RAID-6); b)They are obviously more vulnerable to failing.
155301 Virgie :  Is it wise to change it?
155317 Myrtis :  not really, since you probably will get fragmentation problems at such high usage anyway
155340 Myrtis :  it's an opinion thing
155346 Virgie :  and if I used ext2 instead?
155359 Hermina :  i don't see how RAID can actually be useful.
155360 Myrtis :  it would be the same thing
155369 Myrtis :  use ext3 though, since it has a journal
155378 Myrtis :  Hermina ?
155384 Myrtis :  explain that
155387 Meta :  ouch
155391 Virgie :  right... so basically I need more space
155401 Ceola :  yeah...raid is very usefull.

155439 Lizeth :  i liked raid 0 with windows but with linux i un raided my drives after i saw how stable it was

155466 Gale :  Ceola: and it's merely for performance
155473 Angla :  raid10 ftw
155481 Myrtis :  Hermina at the higher cost levels, you can replace hard drives that are storing data without turning off the computer or losing data. is that not useful?
155487 Ceola :  Gale: and generally doesn't perform for long :-)
155491 Lana :  I have a mirror of a lost HD that is split into 40 files of 2GB each. it was generated with "cat /dev/hda2 | split ...". how to mount -o loop a device that is split into 40 files?
155495 Gale :  if anything, it highly increases probability of data loss instead of reducing it
155498 Ceola :  0+1 is nice for performance
155503 Lizeth :  i was rebuilding arrays weekly in windows
155521 Hermina :  Myrtis: maybe it's just too complicated for me.
155539 Hye *  entered the room.
155545 Myrtis :  (at lower cost levels, you have to turn off the computer to replace the drive, but you still retain data)
155579 Ceola :  hot swap is nice....we use ultra 320, raids 5
155583 Gale :  I'd only bother with it in a server
155605 Gale :  raid arrays
155606 Hyo *  entered the room.

155708 Hyo :  Myrtis, heh thanks... I didn't know I could delete a macro from a word file :)
155712 Angla :  Gale: raid10 in music recording, mixing, post-production/mastering is real nice. i would think video is the same
155724 Myrtis :  sure, you open up the macro editor and remove the code
155743 Myrtis :  usually documents with viruses are bogus though, are you sure this is useful data?
155769 Gale :  Angla: yeah, for those sorts of thing raid0 or raid10 would be a plus
155806 Cleo *  entered the room.
155808 Hyo :  Myrtis, yes, I'm working in a school... I think some macro viruses are working their way through the documents on our smb server

155815 Gale :  Angla: I think it's mainly going to see advantage in the former 2 things you mentioned though
155839 Gale :  I don't think that many games will benefit since most of them cache all their data when they load up usually
155847 Angla :  i see they've put fedora 7 back a week. i wanted to start the ball rolling today. damn

156323 Myrtis :  um
156331 Anastasia :  It said file not found

156363 Li *  entered the room.
156367 Myrtis :  anyway, why not just copy the mbr code from one drive to the other
156367 Camellia :  Myrtis: you mounted /dev and /proc?
156370 Anastasia :  I'm doing this on an already booted system.
156372 Myrtis :  since they are identical it doesn't matter
156374 Camellia :  Anastasia: you mounted /dev and /proc?
156393 Cyndi *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
156393 Gale :  Ceola: was it running fine before?

156495 Li :  I want to remove a user from a group, and I found this in the man pages,  If called with two non-option arguments, deluser will remove a user from a specific group."  So I don't accidentally delete the user, what is the order for this command?
156564 Gale :  Ceola: I can't imagine it being the drivers unless they were changed around when the problems started cropping up
156584 Antonietta :  Li: deluser [options] user group, man says
156600 Gale :  Ceola: what is the exact error message?
156611 Jonell *  left the room (quit: "WeeChat 0.2.3").
156613 Ceola :  I have 2 almost duplicate systems...same hardware, same kernels...some different software running, but all Quinton software is the same.
156626 Li :  Antonietta, Thank you.
156628 Anastasia :  Kevin': How will copyin the MBR help?
156649 Myrtis :  Anastasia you were doing raid1 right? since it's the same on both drives you can just copy the code for grub
156655 Ceola :  Gale: depending on what I am trying to run  I may get a line number, for example fsck says "Line 4: Input Output Error"
156689 Anastasia :  Kevin': yes, but will it help boot the system? Neither HD can boot by itself.
156694 Sommer *  left the room (quit: "Lost terminal").
156695 Gale :  Ceola: I would try a different drive then
156705 Melany *  entered the room.
156706 Myrtis :  Anastasia I thought grub was already booting on both drives?
156711 Gale :  Ceola: or try those drives in another system
156714 Myrtis :  you had some error with ubuntu's init stuff
156720 Gale :  Ceola: and see if they still have the same problem
156775 Myrtis :  Anastasia if the Quinton is getting loaded it's not a problem with grub
156781 Anastasia :  Kevin': It only boots when both HDs are present. When any 1 gets removed, it doesn't boot.
156782 Ceola :  Gale: hmmmm.    I'm probably going to tell dell that it is the raid controller.  I have to drive 200 miles to have physical access.
156810 Felisha *  entered the room.
156827 Felisha *  left the room.
156829 Myrtis :  Anastasia doesn't boot at all?
156835 Myrtis :  Anastasia does the bios detect the drives?
156842 Hermina :  Ceola: you have to buy a lot of gas.
156868 Ceola :  Hermina:   that's ok...company re-imburses for that.
156871 Anastasia :  Kevin': It boots until the Ubuntu spash screen. I disabled the quiet boot and go the error msg "waiting for root filesystem" in the beginning, with the progress bar all the way to the left.
156898 Kraig *  entered the room.
156903 Ceola :  Hermina: and I fortify my diet w/ extra beans, so that helps too
156906 Myrtis :  then it IS booting, but you have a problem with the ubuntu init process
156922 Hermina :  Ceola: are beans healthy?  just curious.
156929 Gale :  Anastasia: might not have the necessary fs drivers loaded
156962 Anastasia :  Kevin' , Gale: Is that easy to fix? I don't understand why it's so complicated just to setup a simple software RAID-1 array.
156968 Gale :  Anastasia: whatever you root fs is, you need to make sure that it's drivers are in your initrd or compiled into the Quinton
156976 Hermina :  Ceola: aren't beans an ingredient for gasoline?
156994 Myrtis :  Anastasia it's an ubuntu problem. it shouldn't be compicated, but I don't know what the problem is, I don't use ubuntu :)
156996 Anastasia :  Gale: Drivers? For RAID?
157000 Gale :  Anastasia: sounds also, like there's some other drivers you're going to need as well since it's raid
157008 Gale :  Anastasia: yeah
157021 Colene *  entered the room.
157021 Anastasia :  Gale: But it's software RAID. What kind of drivers?
157044 Gale :  Anastasia: pretty much any drivers to be able to utilize your HDs and root fs need to be loaded by that point
157062 Hermina :  because ubuntu only works out of the box.  days later, it'll BSOD.
157084 Anastasia :  Gale: I don't understand why I need extra drivers to boot the same HD. How do I fix this?
157105 Gale :  Anastasia: are you using the distro's Quinton image?
157110 Fermina *  entered the room.

159278 Rachel :  Claude: oh
159286 Claude :  Gale: I put it at the end of the script and made a sleep 15 before...
159293 Rachel :  Gale: good idea, ethernet must be there before ssh.
159295 Claude :  because I thought that could be the problem :)
159314 Rachel :  Claude: does ssh log any errs?
159321 Lona :  Okay all... I've come under fire of a rather unusual means... VNC. I left VNC open for my own use, but somehow someone has connected to me via VNC and from there downloaded and installed some program from the "TFTP" server `76.215.109.177'. If you did it... please own up and tell me what the program does... I won't bite your head off; I just need to track down who did this. Thanks all. (If you're o

159525 Janay *  entered the room.
159551 Claude :  Rachel: the tunnel start is already in the rc.local. I have added a sleep record in there, and I can log in via normal ssh (not tunneled as I am onsite) and see my "sleep" in "ps aux". When I open a tunnel right then as the rc.local is still asleep the tunnel works. So the system is ready at that time...

162806 Lajuana :  Larraine: across one filesystem, this is pretty much instantaneous (being just a metadata update); if you're moving it across filesystems it's actually a copy-delete so it'll take longer.

163467 Jeanelle :  Luella:  I just did that (that's the same as -v -v -v"
163469 Leota :  Gia: it worked on lsmod, but not on ifup eth0,   ifup eth0 > log.txt, it still had konsole output

163576 Dexter *  entered the room.
163577 Gia :  Aron: none of those things matter, all that matters is how much data is coming over the network

163650 Aron :  how big is a typical single wlan packet?
163655 Yesenia :  ok, so my question now is.. is there a way to pipe the output of svnadmin dump (it dumps the contents to the console, so you'd normally use svnadmin dump blah > file.bak) to gzip?
163664 Gia :  if it's a very active network maybe a few hours, if it's not it could take days/weeks
163677 Jeanelle :  Yesenia: svnadmin dump blah | gzip > file.bak ?
163684 Gia :  Aron: ranges anywhere from a few bytes to 1.5KB or so
163695 Aron :  ok.
163710 Latoria *  entered the room.
163720 Jeanelle :  Luella: any tips how I'd figure out what's wrong / fix it?

164283 Gia :  Yesenia: weird. installing ssh or openssh should get you that. try asking #fedora too
164299 Gia :  that's not the proper way to do it on fedora, he should use the package manager or else risk clobbering stuff
164301 Yesenia :  Aron: why would I do that when I have a package manager that most certainly has it?
164308 Kory *  entered the room.
164312 Aron :  Fedora's gay!

164418 Lona :  0.o
164436 Larraine :  Hermina, so you are saying my syntax is correct?
164449 Hermina :  Larraine: yes.  that's correct.
164480 Larraine :  I'm doing this beginners guide to Linux that we have to do in school.. thing is I'm using Linux myself.. and it only accepts certain syntax is it seems :P
164484 Larraine :  since you can write in a few ways
164506 Aron :  but if you want to move the movies within "action" just do: mkdir /movies/action && cd action && mv * ../movies/action

164558 Leota :  Anyone know how to send the output of a program into tty2?
164563 Larraine :  which is mega stupid
164572 Aron :  Larraine: as a pointer, when you're typing in the name of a file or a directory in the shell, so long as you have the first or second or first few letters completed you can just hit tab and it will complete the rest.
164583 Larraine :  yah
164592 Larraine :  I know of tab completion before I came to unix/linux

164636 Larraine :  or well.. im entering them in a HTML form
164640 Aron :  Ah, ok. Nice good ol pen scratch!
164641 Larraine :  so its not a real shell

164768 Edna *  left the room (quit: SendQ exceeded).
164768 Larraine :  because in his PHP script
164771 Larraine :  he hard coded those values
164783 Larraine :  then he compares the strings.. if $a==$b
164793 Larraine :  so it ditches correct syntax too
164806 Edna *  entered the room.
164812 Kimbra *  entered the room.

My teacher says the computer is good at it. At the same time he says that it's not good at making spontaneous decisions (which it also can be in that case, since the user can be spontaneous)

168707 Dagny :  Larraine: Well Hoa's info should work unless there's already a directory called folder1 in folder2/
168708 Lajuana :  Larraine: so, what's the error it gives when you try?
168726 Larraine :  Lajuana, Georgia error I get is "You get 0 out of 1 point"
168730 Klara *  entered the room.

168769 Dagny :  Larraine: Tell your teacher they score nil point
168775 Chauncey *  entered the room.
168784 Larraine :  any tips of other syntax my teacher might expect in this case? lol
168795 Larraine :  I am in a dir, and want to put one sub-dir in the other
168799 Dagny :  Larraine: Yeah, tell them to try reading "man mv" !
168803 Larraine :  mv -r dir1 dir2/
168806 Aron :  all i need is a glib installer package for windows and i'm set.
168812 Lajuana :  There's no -r to mv.
168816 Lajuana :  It's just "mv source dest"
168823 Aron :  mv -r lol
168827 Larraine :  AMG :P
168832 Lajuana :  If dest doesn't exist, it renames. If dest exists and is a dir, it moves source /into/ dest.
168833 Hoa :  Larraine: you don't need -r, definitely
168865 Hoa :  mv folder1 folder2/ OR mv folder1 folder2 OR mv folder1/ folder2/
168868 Hoa :  can't really think of anything else
168872 Sharell *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
168877 Hoa :  unless they copied it and then deleted the original, just to be awkward  :)
168899 Evelyne *  entered the room.
168903 Myrtis :  mv in the same filesystem is a lot faster then cp, of course
168915 Myrtis :  almost instant, rather then not
168918 Dagny :  Larraine: You sure your teacher isn't using Windows? also, try "cp folder1 folder2/"
168929 Voncile *  is now known as Voncile
168945 Aron :  Larraine: create a note! touch file.txt && nano file.txt || vi file.txt
168949 Larraine :  Dagny, if I do cp when I'm supposed to do mv he will flame me
168952 Lajuana :  Dagny: (1) cp is not mv (2) cp will not copy directories by default
168964 Dagny :  BTW, cp -r does recursive dirs
168968 Larraine :  Aron, why would I create a note on my own comp?
168972 Myrtis :  cp -a, recommended
168975 Antonio *  entered the room.
168977 Voncile *  is now known as Voncile
168980 Lajuana :  You need cp -a or cp -r. And in either case it won't do what he needs.
168988 Myrtis :  I create notes on my computer all the time
169018 Rosanne :  tar -cpf - folder1/ | tar -xpf - -C /folder2/; rm -Rf folder1
169028 Dagny :  Larraine: What is the scenario this test assumes?
169030 Peg *  entered the room.
169053 Peg :  is there something similar to apple ][ basic in linux?
169057 Kali :  Lajuana: copying
169065 Dagny :  Peg: PERL :)
169071 Shelley *  left the room.
169077 Peg :  but perl cant draw
169078 Aron :  mv location destination ... rm file.extension ... cp filename.ext destination/ ... cp -R directoryname destination ... file * = file types, du -ak directoryname = filesizes ... ls -lSr = ordered list of files with sizes permissions grouping etc
169087 Aron :  that's why Larraine
169123 Dagny :  Peg: what is it you need? most languages have extension graphics libraries like GD
169128 Peg :  id like to draw on in paint handler but it to remember the frame
169139 Peg :  not it paint handler
169141 Lajuana :  Kali: You could do it with cp, but rsync -avv --progress source/ dest is a better choice
169143 Aron :  Larraine: that's the lowdown...
169156 Lajuana :  Kali: the trailing / will cause it to copy the directory contents rather than the directory itself.
169170 Lajuana :  And using rsync ensures that it gets .files and so forth as well.
169180 Kali :  .files meaning?
169183 Andrew *  left the room (quit: "[- Cerebro Script -]").
169183 Kali :  .htaccess and such?

169762 Felicia :  you need a .
169766 Felicia :  Larraine:
169775 Shawanda :  is there any free virus scanner out there for linux? (something like antivir for windows maybe)
169785 Larraine :  it's ok
169786 Larraine :  I got it now :p
169787 Larraine :  finally
169799 Laurine :  Lajuana, that's what I did, and I got about 4.63TB/month if I'm at 15Mbit/s sustained..  -is that 100% correct?
169799 Lajuana :  Shawanda: there's a version of AVG for it, I believe.
169805 Dean :  Shawanda: avlinux
169806 Bennett :  Laurine: 5 i my math is right
169812 Felicia :  Larraine: lets see it
169814 Dean :  Shawanda: sorry, clamav
169817 Laurine :  Bennett, thanks..  anyone else?
169826 Bennett :  Lajuana: data transder speeds are usually base_10, so its not 1024
169828 Dean :  Shawanda: had a brain giltch there for a second. :)
169837 Larraine :  Felicia, can't show it.. it got checked by the comp.. and turned out to be correct
169838 Lajuana :  Laurine: GS>15 1024 mul 1024 mul 8 div 60 mul 60 mul 24 mul 30 mul 1024 1024 mul 1024 mul 1024 mul div ==

169842 Larraine :  :P
169847 Bennett :  but (15000000/8) *31*24*60*60 should be right
169851 Laurine :  yah, that's what I got, too..
169858 Felicia :  Larraine: i'm not asking for my sake
169860 Shawanda :  ok another thing: I cant start firefox, it tells me firefox is running but frozen and I need to close it
169860 Dean :  Laurine: Hope you know what you are doing. :)
169866 Bennett :  which comes to 5.022 TB here
169868 Shawanda :  but I cant find a firefox process
169878 Lajuana :  Shawanda: it's called "firefox-bin" or somesuch

169944 Laurine :  Bennett, using 1024 instead of 1000 gave me ~4.63
169952 Bennett :  Laurine: usually in transfer speeds one uses base_10

170091 Bennett :  as they are usually bound to a frequency which is base_10
170137 Bennett :  but you could calculate a worst case by assuming base_2 and thus you should come out on the safe side

170263 Shawanda :  Lajuana thank you for your help, but I cant find it. maybe a firefox bug... it is saved as being running somewhere... that could be possible, depending on the way how firefox finds out that its already running. Im sure a restart will fix that

170404 Corrin :  hi
170410 Aron :  38.31481933593750000000
170427 Aron :  is the number of terabytes you can do in a month with a connection at 15mbps going 24/7

170449 Aron :  and that applys to either upstream or downstream
170453 Rickie :  that's a lot of terabytes
170462 Bennett :  Aron: I think you have that a factor 8 wrong, as his speed was in bits not bytes
170465 Laurine :  Aron, I think you're off by a factor of ~8 because you didn't translate Megabits/s into TeraBytes/month?
170469 Aron :  well 15mbps is pretty crazy

170473 Rickie :  pwnt
170474 Bennett :  at least that was my understanding from the initial question
170477 Hermina :  Hyun: that's the problem with corporate distros.  they think they got you taken care of.
170479 Aron :  no what i did, is right.
170483 Jaymie :  Rachel: this makes sense for most commodities, but I would think software was different enough that different rules and practices would exist.
170490 Jarrett *  entered the room.
170496 Hyun :  sigh :(
170497 Jaymie :  s/was/is/
170498 Aron :  i calculated how many megabytes are in a terabyte
170499 Elli *  entered the room.
170505 Laurine :  Aron, please paste yer math
170506 Aron :  then i calculated how many seconds are in a month
170509 Aron :  sure.

170533 Janine *  entered the room.
170545 Dexter *  entered the room.
170562 Laurine :  ( ((1024 * 1024 * 15 ) / 8) * (30 * 24 * 60 * 60) ) / ( 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 )  ==  ( bytes per seconds ) * ( seconds per month ) / ( byte in a terabytes )   <== that suggests ~4.6348TeraBytes transfer per month at 15Megabits/second sustained 24/7
170563 Aron :  then i calculated the number of mb in a terabyte / 15
170574 Aron :  multiplied that by the amount of seconds in the month
170580 Aron :  and i got my result
170593 Hermina :  Laurine: you are correct.
170598 Bennett :  Laurine: assume 31 days I think that would be more accurate (or at least be the upper bound)
170609 Laurine :  Aron, I think your off somewhere, but I can't see for sure, and where because you've only expressed yer math in english
170620 Bennett :  but otherwise I agree (apart from stil thinking the speed is in base_10)
170623 Aron :  ok let me show you it ...
170626 Hyun *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
170651 Bennett :  Aron: except its not 15 MegeBytes per second, its 15 Megabits per second
170655 Laurine :  Aron, it'd be appreciated, if you think I'm wrong.  (others have suggested I'm right)
170656 Pete *  entered the room.
170657 Aron :  x = seconds in month; x = 60*60*24*31
170683 Lessie :  Hi does anyone know a tool to make a recording of a browser session from firefox? I'd like to make some demo movies of our website to show the management console etc
170700 Geralyn *  entered the room.
170701 Aron :  y = megabytes in a terabyte; x = 1024*1024
170708 Laurine :  Bennett, correct 15Megabits/second.  (~1.875MegaBytes/seconds)
170711 Geralyn :  hello @lll
170715 Laurine :  Aron, no
170732 Laurine :  byte -> kilo -> mega -> giga -> tera
170742 Aron :  yes yes yes...
170750 Aron :  but there are 1024 gb in 1 tb
170753 Jaymie :  Laurine: not exactly.  more like
170758 Aron :  and there are 1024 mb in 1 gb
170770 Aron :  just let me finish
170774 Jaymie :  "" -> "kilo" -> "mega" -> "giga" -> "tera"
170801 Veola :  "buttload"
170802 Laurine :  Jaymie, yes. understood..  just trying to suggest to infinitux that he might be forgetting one.  infinitux, please continue
170803 Aron :  y = 1048576
170806 Dagny :  Remember CaSe is important: M=Mega, m=milli, B=Byte, b=bits
170822 Jaymie :  Laurine: ah. kk.
170823 Laurine :  Aron, your "y" is wrong
170828 Angla *  entered the room.
170836 Bennett :  Laurine: no, its the number of MB in a TB
170842 Jaymie :  Laurine: wow, in retrospect, that was the most anal thing I've said today.
170844 Aron :  nope.
170855 Aron :  just let me finish.
170861 Laurine :  k

170886 Aron :  y / 15 = 69905.0 "6" repeating
170893 Consuela *  entered the room.
170894 Becki :  Aron:  if you were to type your statement out all at once, rather than breaking it into 20 seperate lines, you wouldn't have to yell at people to let you finish.  and saying "let me finish" virtually always mean you're wrong.
170907 Bennett :  Becki: :)
170914 Fermina *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
170917 Laurine :  Aron, please express in math like this:
170920 Aron :  i'm just trying to explain as i go along
170927 Bennett :  Aron: you have forgotten that the 15 is not MB, its Mb
170930 Hermina :  Aron sounds crazy when he says that.
170935 Laurine :  ( ((1024 * 1024 * 15 ) / 8) * (30 * 24 * 60 * 60) ) / ( 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 )  ==  ( bytes per seconds ) * ( seconds per month ) / ( byte in a terabytes )
170937 Bennett :  15 Mb ~ 1.875 MB
170940 Aron :  i'm gonna give you the whole shebang when i'm done explaining
170967 Bennett :  anyway time to make dinner
170978 Felicia :  quit while your ahead already
170998 Becki :  what was the original question anyway?  heh
171005 Dagny :  2+2
171010 Laurine :  hey guys, does this sound like a good deal?:  4 TeraByte transfer per month, on a 100Megabit/s port, for ~$400/month?
171021 Felicia :  How many kibbles are in bits

171237 Rachel :  Jaymie: business is the same, everywhere for everything. :-)   Its ALL negotiable.
171254 Felicia :  heh ..
171258 Rachel :  Angla:  1 terabibble
171267 Forrest :  for shizzle?
171271 Aron :  jesus!
171278 Aron :  seconds in a month 2678400
171278 Aron :  megabytes in a terabyte 1048576
171278 Aron :  a megabyte in terabytes / 15 = 1048576/15 : 69905.0666666...
171278 Aron :  seconds in a month 60*60*24*31 = 2678400
171278 Aron :  result = 2678400/69905.0666666
171280 Aron :  thats it ok...
171282 Rachel :  Aron: Yes my son?
171291 Leola *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

171340 Aron :  mb!
171345 Felicia :  yep
171345 Aron :  megabytes!
171349 Angla :  mb is millibuts
171349 Felicia :  b00b00
171351 Rachel :  Aron: remember mbps is megaBITS, bot Bytes...
171355 Rachel :  *not
171363 Bennett :  Aron: the line speed it 15 mega BITS, not BYTES

171389 Rayford *  entered the room.
171392 Dagny :  quote: " 4 TeraByte transfer per month, on a 100Megabit/s port"
171404 Angla :  probably a good figure is cents per bitsecond
171418 Hal :  can you hot swap IDE drives?
171419 Aron :  that's the isp provision
171424 Bennett :  Dagny: that was not his original question, it was: hey, how many TeraBytes can one possibly send in a month if you have a 15Mbit/s connection sustained 24/7?
171428 Felicia :  I think we need it in Gasoline prices
171433 Bennett :  the other one came in later
171436 Felicia :  10ths of cents
171441 Dagny :  Bennett: ahhh, ok
171456 Evon *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
171466 Felicia :  How about Redemptive Coupon Value ..in .00ths of cents ..lol
171471 Christa *  entered the room.
171476 Dagny :  I can't believe it caused this much messing about!
171479 Angla :  10Mb == 1MB, or 8Mb == 1MB ?
171484 Aron *  left the room (quit: "leaving").

171520 Bennett :  Angla: 8 Mb == 1 MB
171522 Dagny :  When the base unit is Mbits/s then all values should be in binary
171528 Audra *  entered the room.
171541 Audra :  how can I look to see how much space I have left on a HDD?
171543 Dagny :  so you're working to powers of 2, not 10
171556 Jaymie :  Bennett: this question is trivial if you know how to use google calculator.  Google "15 Mb/s * 1 month"
171558 Alesha *  left the room ("Leaving").
171566 Kai :  how do I use OO Base to connect to a mysql DB?
171567 Felicia :  well then .. where's my Giba?
171570 Angla :  Bennett: isn't that the baud rate rather than the "actual bits received" figure ?
171574 Bennett :  Dagny: except that transmission speeds are in base_10, 100 Mbit/s in ethernet is 100000000bits/s
171582 Jaymie :  Angla: right...
171587 Felicia :  er Gibi and Tibi ..lol
171593 Bennett :  Angla: that is raw, ie without any overhead of various kinds yes
171594 Felicia :  er tebi
171594 Pete :  my sendmail is missing sendmail.mc whats the best way to resolve this? I have been having a error of  554 5.0.0 No local mailer defined
171595 Pete :  554 5.0.0 QueueDirectory (Q) option must be set
171606 Felicia :  pebi and pubic
171608 Pete :  so founf out that sendmail.mc is missing.
171613 Dagny :  Bennett: I disagree - the bits/s' infers base 2, and Mbits/s therefore is 1024x1024bits/s
171624 Bennett :  Dagny: read the ethernet specs then:)
171627 Shameka *  entered the room.
171629 Angla :  Bennett: so 10Mb/s == 1MB/s ?
171637 Kathie :  and transmissions speeds in bits converted to bytes depend on the encoding, for example you're typical async character takes 11 bits, 8 bits of word, 1 stop, 1 start, 1 space.
171637 Rachel :  roughly yes.
171641 Evon *  entered the room.
171641 Jaymie :  I thought base 1000 was only for HDD capacity.
171644 Bennett :  Dagny: its only internally in computers one talkes in base_2, linespeeds are usually base_10
171671 Bennett :  Angla: its a factor of 8, one byte is 8 bits
171677 Mistie :  yep
171680 Letty *  entered the room.
171689 Bennett :  Angla: in raw numbers anyway, actual transmission overhead varies
171693 Jaymie :  what about if they're Canadian bytes+
171698 Dagny :  I've always worked to base 2, seems daft to confuse them!
171699 Mistie :  LOL
171700 Vernita *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
171704 Angla :  1 byte received == ~10 bits transferred
171718 Kathie :  11 bits!
171726 Dagny :  Angla: You're harking back to stop bits and parity bits!
171732 Angla :  yes
171733 Humberto *  entered the room.
171736 Jaymie :  Angla: for redundancy and error-detection?
171739 Angla :  because they are transmitted
171743 Bennett :  Angla: depends on protocol/encoding and other things
171743 Rosanne :  Pete, install postfix
171755 Becki :  now, rather than stop and parity, it's frame headers and stuff like that...
171755 Shea *  nods at Bennett
171756 Felicia :  8/10b encoding yo
171764 Darleen *  entered the room.
171765 Bennett :  fast ethernet (100 Mbit/s) transfers 5 bits on the line for every 4 bits of data
171766 Felicia :  serialize that sucka
171779 Bennett :  as that is a part of their on line encoding scheme
171784 Willette *  entered the room.
171802 Jaymie :  Bennett: so 10 bits transferred per byte received is correct...
171804 Arlinda *  left the room ("Coming Back").
171804 Arlinda *  entered the room.
171818 Bennett :  Jaymie: only on the actual ethernet physical layer
171824 Rosanne :  Pete, if a program needs a config file to generate a config file that is a bad sign.
171826 Bennett :  but that runs at 125 Mhz
171844 Angla :  a likely story !
171862 Rina *  left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
171870 Bennett :  so ethernet card to card transfers 125 Mbit/s, but some of that (25) goes to the encoding scheme, and some more goes for ethernet frame headers
171883 Hal *  left the room.
171890 Terresa *  entered the room.
171895 Terresa :  Hello
171901 Bennett :  iirc for TCP/IP an ethernet/adsl 9 bits per byte gives fairly accurate estimates as to how much actual data you can move
171905 Latoria *  left the room (quit: ).
171911 Terresa :  Do you know how can I remove the DC offest on fly?
171923 Bennett :  DC offset?
171932 Angla :  actually, i think we should posit a new virtual particle, the "biticule", to account for the discrepancy
171932 Bennett :  as in Direct Current?
171949 Rosanne :  district of columbia?
171950 Angla :  Terresa: from what ?
171955 Bennett :  anyway I have to look at my dinner
171958 Terresa :  From my microphone
171961 Forrest :  Direct connect?
171978 Becki :  your microphone shouldn't have a dc offset...  if it does, get a new sound card.  one that works, for example.
171987 Forrest :  lol
171991 Felicia :  you may want to not only look at it
171995 Angla :  Terresa: you've identified a very important feature. have you got a spectrum analyzer going ?
172009 Angla :  Becki: all sound cards have a dc error
172011 Terresa :  Angla, I've detected it with audacity
172018 Fredrick *  entered the room.
172023 Terresa :  Angla, but some days ago I hadn't got any problems
172026 Humberto :  Is it possible to place a quota on a ramdisk?
172034 Porsha *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
172034 Becki :  Angla:  yeah, typically less than 1/2LSB.
172038 Felicia :  audacity has a provision to correct that iirc .. not that it's awesome or anything
172047 Angla :  Terresa: the usual method is to average all the sample values, and subtract that from them all
172058 Terresa :  Yes, but in skype, teamspeak my vioce gets distorted
172060 Fredrick *  left the room ("Leaving").
172094 Becki :  if you're having a dc offset of more than a few LSB, your sound card is likely faulty...  anything bad enough to cause distortion would fit this.
172099 Felicia :  lol .. audacity for phone calls? .. oh my
172108 Terresa :  Felicia, no...
172115 Terresa :  I can't use audacity for calls
172124 Brandie *  entered the room.
172124 Shawanda :  lol
172125 Terresa :  So I can't fix the dc offset with it
172143 Gia :  that's a hardware issue so probably not
172149 Angla :  Becki: how many soundcards have you tested personally ? i've used over 100. and the only one with anything like 0 dc error is the m-audio 1712/1724
172153 Terresa :  http://img472.imageshack.us/img472/7876/screenqu0.jpg
172154 Felicia :  so yu want it done on the fly then?
172161 Terresa :  yes
172177 Felicia :  well then say /ask that
172193 Felicia :  my ... you did
172197 Felicia :  apologies Terresa
172201 Terresa :  np :)
172201 Felicia :  my bad
172201 Dagny :  lol
172211 Felicia :  f'cker ..lol
172221 Becki :  Angla:  not too many, but I've never seen an offset, and most a/d converters specify at most a couple LSBs of offset...
172240 Becki :  and enough offset to cause distortion, as he reports, would be a major offset.
172242 Dagny :  Terresa: is the offset caused the by microphone itself? or the sound hardware?
172247 Nilsa *  entered the room.
172254 Terresa :  Dagny, I don't know
172260 Becki :  it takes a fair amount of bias to cause distortion.
172262 Terresa :  Everything was perfect some days ago
172277 Angla :  Terresa: you *could* write a dc error estimator/subtractor and hook it in as an alsa plugin. i don't know of any such offhand tho. i do my own dc error correction, within the apps
172280 Dagny :  Terresa: do some tests with audacity, and alternate microphones
172285 Terresa :  Becki, not really distortion, but annoying high pitch
172287 Wilton *  entered the room.
172297 Becki :  annoying high pitch is not likely to be caused by a dc offset.  :)
172303 Angla :  indeed
172306 Terresa :  I can't explain it :D
172314 Wilton :  hi, anyone familiar with ipsec. i've heard about a mode for ipsec that encrypts senders address field as well, is that true?
172318 Dagny :  Terresa:  post a screenshot of it taken from Audacity then
172323 Terresa :  My voice is crappy, then, with that dc offset :D
172331 Terresa :  screen: http://img472.imageshack.us/img472/7876/screenqu0.jpg
172352 Forrest :  Terresa, there is a way to remove it in hardware with an inline capacitor, i don't know the exact details
172357 Dagny :  yup, that is some DC offset :)
172361 Forrest :  some EE expert should know
172367 Chauncey *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
172368 Dexter *  entered the room.
172388 Becki :  I like to get the dc bias on my amplifiers down to under 10mv, but I've had it as high as a volt while tweaking it, and I'd be damned if I could hear a difference...  heh
172391 Darleen *  left the room.
172396 Dagny :  Terresa: If you unplug the microphone but record from that input, do you still see an offset?
172399 Chauncey *  entered the room.
172399 Marybelle *  left the room (quit: ":tiuQ").
172406 Rayford *  left the room (quit: "leaving").
172421 Angla :  Forrest: that is sorta right. however, the cap affects the frequency response somewhat. lots of low freqs get sqyuished, not just dc
172422 Terresa :  Dagny, yes
172429 Becki :  Terresa:  I know this is a stupid suggestion, but...  wiggle every plug to the microphone around, unlug them, plug them back in, and try again.
172436 Pete :  who knows sendmail and its configuration issues? I am missing sendmail.mc and want to know what may have caused this.
172436 Dagny :  Becki: good point, offset doesn't by itself cause major distortion
172442 Becki :  a dc offset like that is a bad card.
172453 Angla :  yes, bad card
172453 Becki :  if you unplug it, and it still gets that bad off an offset, it's time to toss it.
172457 Mistie *  left the room.
172457 Dagny :  Terresa: so you've got a sound hardware issue then
172474 Lizbeth *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
172480 Dagny :  Terresa:  have you messed with the PC in any way recently; you said it only started recently?
172487 Angla :  very bad card by the looks of it. the dc error is about 10% of fsd
172502 Rosanne :  Pete, AFAIK there is no way to generate an mc file from an existing cf file.  you're going to have to recreate it or manually hack the cf file to make it do what you want.
172503 Terresa :  No :S
172507 Dagny :  Everyone pile over to #hardware :p
172525 Terresa :  I've muted and unplugged everything
172532 Yu *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
172533 Becki :  Dagny:  nope...  it causes some distortion in class B amplifiers (a bad offset is a sure sign your bias currents are wrong, and will cause switching distortion), but as sound waves are essentially ac-coupled, offset doesn't cause distortion in most cases...
172533 Terresa :  There's still the offset
172538 Geralyn :  sry for my noobquesten but how i can disable ndiswrapper for testing other drivers?
172553 Argentina *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
172558 Felicia :  Wilton: i dunno ..see http://www.ipsec-howto.org/x501.html
172565 Terresa :  So I have to change my mobo :)
172566 Rosanne :  Geralyn, rmmod ndiswrapper ?
172566 Angla :  Geralyn: modprobe -r ndiswrapper
172568 Terresa :  Thank you
172594 Becki :  ugh, on-board sound.  :)
172594 Dagny :  Terresa:  you might be able to adjust something on the mobo itself
172605 Latoria *  entered the room.
172613 Becki :  Terresa:  check for exploding capacitors?  :)
172635 Terresa :  :D
172638 Dagny :  Terresa: many mobo's have a jumper to select which microphone input to use, with an option for a front-mounted socket to take over from the backplane socket
172638 Terresa :  boooooooooooom
172662 Becki :  as a rule, on-board sound sucks.  get a real sound card, and disable the on-board one.  no more problems.
172671 Geralyn :  lol now it worked...today i had the prob that after i maked modprobe -r ndiwswrapper the driver was loaded again when i put in my card
172675 Geralyn :  thx anyway
172690 Terresa :  Becki, anyway I've been having some errors with this new setup

172725 Bennett :  Dagny: nope, creative has PCMCIA soundblasters:)
172736 Dagny :  I've never had a problem with onboard sound, aside from no sound when I hadn't put the jumpers on the mobo's input selector pins :)
172747 Terresa :  I'm having compiling errors...segfaults
172758 Bennett :  Dagny: then again most laptop users are probably not that caring about HiFI quality while travelling
172762 Dagny :  Bennett: Like i'm gonna carry the damned speakers around like a boom-box! lol
172782 Becki :  Terresa:  what motherboard is this?
172787 Dagny :  Bennett: Well, true, but with integrated HDA now, an external card is rarely required

172969 Dagny :  Why is it the channels for specific packages rarely have anyone contributing, but lots logged in?
172971 Becki :  (just in case the sound card uses one of the negative voltages...)
172995 Becki :  Dagny:  umm, how many users are in this channel, and how many are active right now?

173027 Craig :  sounds like congress
173036 Dagny :  Becki:  yes but I rarely find that its like a tomb on here. I mean, if you aren't around to chat, why be logged in at all?
173048 Angla :  actually #ubuntu has over 1200 users
173049 Dagny :  ADSL/cable have a lot to answer for!
173062 Angla :  ... but they all end up here eventually
173067 Craig :  Dagny: developers for packages are typically more responsive on mailing lists
173068 Forrest :  so you can log the chats and read them later!
173076 Craig :  irc is seen as nothing more than a distraction by most
173084 Forrest :  save them for a rainy day
173087 Dagny :  Craig: Indeed, but my point about being in chat if you're *not* chatting holds

173672 Craig :  Mel: in my experience, they have always been slow

174301 Brinda *  entered the room.
174303 Becki :  it's input gain, but all that would do is amplify Spencer already existing problem...

174364 Bennett :  Becki: true, if its the input DC offset thing you are still discussing

174526 Anastasia :  Craig: Ubuntu cannot detect it, is there a cmd like "lspci" to list the device using the parallel port?
174546 Terresa :  With Input Gain 0,5/1 it's perfect
174562 Becki :  parallel-port autodection was mostly advertising hype...  there's no actually-used standard for it.
174575 Anastasia :  So should I reboot?
174581 Becki :  no.  how would that help?
174599 Anastasia :  Is there a way to get it to work then?

179582 Arlie :  Glennis, but as i said, make sure the mixer settings are all at 100%
179591 Meta :  hrm
179596 Arlie :  Glennis, and if your sound card has Spencer equalizer, turn those settings up to 100% as well
179598 Meta :  now i'm thinking it's a software problem
179607 Felicia :  Meta: didn't you say some codecs just didn't work?
179611 Toney *  entered the room.
179616 Felicia :  some lbsap shit or somesuch
179649 Meta :  Felicia: I'm merely trying to play bunch of mp3s via xmms
179650 Glennis :  okie, thanks again
179656 Meta :  it was working fine a few hours ago
179665 Meta :  then i left for the cinema...
179665 Arlie :  Glennis, i read on the web somewhere that the sound card should record some noise, even without a microphone plugged in, but i cant say ive tried it, and its no guarantee yours will
179679 Roselia *  entered the room.
179680 Arlie :  Glennis, so as i said, you may need a microphone
179682 Felicia :  Glennis: make sure you have all necessary als pkgs installed (alsa-mixer, alsa-utils, whatever)
179687 Glennis :  well i have some cheapo mics sitting around so that shouldnt be a prob
179710 Felicia :  Meta: ahhh .. the pc ghost got at it
179714 Meta :  grr
179719 Meta :  /dev/dsp is there!!
179722 Arlie :  Glennis, yeah, then just blow a fan at it ... the wind from the fan directly on the mic should generate a random wind like noise
179742 Felicia :  Meta: maybe the song ended ..lol
179749 Meta :  heh, nope
179750 Bennett :  Arlie: or at least something not entirely constant:)
179752 Meta :  it's playing
179758 Rosanne :  Meta, have you tried using something other than xmms?  sometimes it forgets my configuration and i have to re-select the device in the xmms options.
179764 Felicia :  Meta: lsof /dev/dsp
179767 Arlie :  Bennett, right
179774 Adelle *  would expect the "noise" from a fan to have a rather high cross correlation
179781 Bennett :  comparet to pure white noise anyway
179784 Arlie :  Bennett, there might be some rotational element to it, but it shouldnt be constant or predictable
179786 Anya :  anybody willing to help me set up a chroot for irssi and screen?

179854 Vernon *  left the room.
179857 Arlie :  Bennett, it can sound regular and still not be regular
179859 Bennett :  so 2 samples following each other would tend to be similiar (I expect, I've not tried this)
179864 Bennett :  Arlie: sure
179866 Meta :  Felicia: I turned my computer off before i went out, so there's no chance that some process raped it..
179873 Felicia :  Meta: artsd or esd may have stolen it or something
179883 Bennett :  Arlie: but a fan sounds very little like white noise, which is what you ideally want
179885 Felicia :  sure there is
179887 Cindi :  thanks Felicia
179895 Felicia :  it just did at bootup

180070 Bennett :  Arlie: sure (to the first one) still not convinced its very white

180081 Emmett :  so any one going to post?
180082 Felicia :  Meta: make sure you oss_wrapper modules are loaded use lsmod
180096 Arlie :  Bennett, because the air flow into and around the mic element is turbulent
180108 Phoebe *  left the room.

180189 Arlie :  Bennett, as i said, there may very well be a rotational element in it, due to the rotation of the fan, however, if he really wanted to, he could use Spencer FFT to remove the dominant frequencies
180191 Matt *  curses god
180230 Bennett :  Arlie: he could
180240 Bennett :  it might not matter at all depending on the purpose

180291 Glennis :  well we could use the setup Arlie mentioned last night... http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/
180294 Bennett :  Arlie: which also varries in quality:)
180296 Arlie :  Bennett, i also suggested he could use Spencer fm tuner card, but his box has a sound card already

181678 Thomasina *  entered the room.
181680 Candice :  Anastasia: and whats the issue that makes you do this?
181711 Anastasia :  Candice: I installed software RAID-1, which boots *only* when both HDs are present.

181714 Dion :  Hey all. Having a slight problem with proftpd - it has a really long delay between me requesting a file and getting a response, and most apps are timing out. Its on the local network, and ping times are good, so I'm assuming it must be a proftpd config error?
181720 Earnestine *  left the room.
181734 Anastasia :  Candice: Take either one out, and I get "waiting for root filesystem." That makes RAID even worse!

181760 Rosanne :  Anabel, esmtp can be used to relay to a remote server, might be easier to program with than nc because it will handle the smtp transaction for you.
181774 Kareem *  entered the room.
181811 Candice :  Anastasia: thats pointless. You can boot wa RAID1 partition _without_ sw RAID.
181818 Anastasia :  With all of this erasing, partitioning, formatting, reinstalling, rebooting, I think the HDs are better off on their own than RAID.
181818 Moira *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).

181846 Senaida :  hi

181878 Senaida :  and can work as proxy/
181892 Leesa *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
181903 Candice :  Anastasia: well, if they are mirrored, then the content of all three block devices is _identical_, so each of /dev/hda1 and /dev/hdb1 is the same as that of /dev/md0
181923 Basilia *  entered the room.
181923 Anastasia :  ok
181944 Candice :  Anastasia: so if /dev/md0 cannot work because /dev/hdb1 is gone, you can boot with 'root=/dev/hda1' instead of 'root=/dev/md0'
181967 Salvador :  What's a good way to pipe output to different locations depending on a regex match?
181971 Anastasia :  Candice: How do I do that?? LiveCD?
181982 Candice :  Anastasia: anyhow you can tell the MD (or DM) RAID sw that it is a damaged RAID and that it is missing one of the two halves.
181984 Maegan *  entered the room.
181988 Alta :  Anastasia: maybe md-mod.start_dirty_degraded=1 as a Quinton boot option would work (it's documented in md.txt)
181994 Anabel :  ok guys, thanks for the help

182008 Avery *  entered the room.
182014 Anastasia :  Alta: Where would I run that cmd?
182027 Candice :  Anastasia: booting with just 'root=/dev/hda1' you can do on the Quinton command line, telling MD or DM that the RAID1 is damaged you can do with a liveCD.
182046 Diann *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
182061 Anastasia :  Candice: How do I boot like that?
182065 Alta :  Anastasia: it's not a command, it's a boot parameter recognised by the md layer. you'd put it in your bootloader conf.
182081 Alta :  Anastasia: (as a Quinton parameter)
182084 Lajuana :  Salvador: well, you can easily implement nifty-widget as a bash function, or even > `nifty_widget ...`
182106 Anastasia :  Candice, Alta: So in /boot/grub/menu.lst?
182108 Candice :  Anastasia: depends on your boot loader. Perhaps you need a bit more familiarity with the basics of GNU/Linux sysadm before attempting RAID recovery...
182111 Kary *  left the room (quit: SendQ exceeded).
182114 Lajuana :  Although I'm not sure I grok the details. What are you regex matching /on/, the piped text? You want to dispatch each line to a seperate file based on regexes?

182670 Salvador :  Thanks, Lajuana
182682 Sueann :  Rosanne: it's the midnight commander.... using the menu to tar up a file
182683 Arlen :  Sueann: it's looking for /bin/sh, not /sbin/sh
182697 Edna *  left the room (quit: "leaving").
182707 Sueann :  Bruno_: that was a typo, sorry.... /bin/sh symlinks to /bin/bash
182723 Felicia :  Anastasia: raid level? and only involves md? or are there layers of lvm and stuffs
182731 Anastasia :  Alta: What line should I add to /boot/grub/menu.lst?
182750 Sheree *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
182755 Anastasia :  Felicia: software RAID-1, md0-2
182776 Leigha *  left the room (quit: ""Input/output error" - the only way to quit IRC in style").
182777 Alta :  Anastasia: I don't think my suggestion will work anyway.
182796 Felicia :  Anastasia: why root on raid? see rootraiddoc.97.html
182808 Anastasia :  I'll just switch to Microsoft Windows Server 2003-It worked perfectly.
182821 Renate *  entered the room.
182823 Franklin *  entered the room.
182824 Felicia :  lol
182827 Elli :  hah
182836 Lana *  left the room (quit: "Fui embora").
182837 Anastasia :  Is Windows 2003 that much worse than Ubuntu?
182839 Rosanne :  thems fightin words
182841 Regine *  slaps Anastasia around with a large trout
182855 Humberto *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
182861 Kenna *  entered the room.
182862 Anastasia :  Felicia: I was able to install RAID in 2 minutes.
182864 Elli :  Anastasia, depends what you want to do, but windows as a server is generally not a good idea... If you ask me, that is
182866 Felicia :  if you're going to give up that easily, then i'm no longer going to tell you how to fix it
182873 Sueann :  I can also execute the shell...
182879 Sueann :  it just doesn't worj from the midnight commander
182880 Kenna :  hi
182883 Alana *  entered the room.
182895 Kenna :  do you know some spftware for searching and dowloading mp3 ?
182899 Kenna :  software
182903 Felicia :  Anastasia: have you ever had Linux softRAID  working on that box?
182904 Kenna :  for linux
182908 Jeri *  left the room (quit: SendQ exceeded).
182911 Leola *  entered the room.
182913 Alta :  Anastasia: what Candice said is valid. you can add grub entries where root is changed to be either constituent partition of the array.
182919 Sueann :  found it!!!
182926 Kenna :  help
182927 Anastasia :  Felicia: I wasted (I'm not making anything up) 20 hours of my time trying to get it to work!! I stayed up until midnight yesterday. I have a stack of printouts.
182934 Felicia :  Anastasia: likely a hardware incompatibility (or more to the point, unloaded modules)
182936 Sueann :  Stupid rack space mounted /tmp with noexec : /dev/cciss/c0d0p2 on /tmp type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)
182954 Jose *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
182958 Kenna :  do you know some software for searching and dowloading mp3 ?
182970 Anastasia :  Kenna: amule
182975 Kenna :  what application you using
182990 Chery *  entered the room.
182991 Anastasia :  Kenna: sudo apt-get install amule
183003 Anastasia :  Kenna: best program ever for downloading any type of file.
183005 Arlen :  Kenna: use ktorrent or azureus
183015 Kenna :  you mean slapt-get ?:D
183023 Kathleen :  how do i upload a podcast to my ipod?
183027 Anastasia :  Bruno_: amule has more files than torrents.
183044 Alta :  Anastasia: also, did you set the partition type properly for the partitions involved? they should be type fd raid-autodetect.
183051 Kathleen :  Felicia, speak up
183067 Leigha *  entered the room.
183067 Felicia :  Anastasia: so you're trying to do a mock rescue? --> <Anastasia> Candice: I installed software RAID-1, which boots only when both HDs are present. <-- for assurity?
183076 Felicia :  Kathleen: welcome
183082 Kathleen :  Felicia,
183083 Kathleen :  how do i upload a podcast to my ipod?
183085 Felicia :  :-p
183091 Anastasia :  Alta: I just partitioned them as RAID in the alternate boot CD.
183092 Felicia :  your welcome ..
183093 Kenna :  swaret --install amule
183094 Kathleen *  is now known as Kathleen
183094 Arlen :  Sueann: odd. maybe i misread the error, but it seems to me that bash complais that the script /tmp/mc-root/mcusrdyHF6d specified a bad interpreter "/bin/sh". Perhaps check for invisible odd characters stuck in the #!-line?
183097 Jenelle *  entered the room.
183100 Felicia :  how the heck should i know Izola
183108 Felicia :  Kathleen:
183109 Kathleen :  Izola?
183112 Kathleen :  yes
183113 Kathleen :  Kathleen
183113 Felicia :  bastage nicks
183122 Kathleen :  no my wifey puter
183127 Romelia *  entered the room.
183128 Madalene *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
183129 Felicia :   Kathleen is now known as Kathleen
183131 Alta :  Anastasia: worth a look. run fdisk -l /dev/sda and fdisk -l /dev/sdb (or whatever the disk names are)
183132 Felicia :  wtf is that?
183133 Jenelle *  is now known as Jenelle
183133 Kathleen :  yes
183134 Sueann :  Bruno_: I symlinked /tmp/mc-root/ to /root/mc-root and now it all works
183141 Alta :  Anastasia: any partition that's part of Spencer array should be shown as "raid auto-detect".
183142 Anastasia :  Felicia: I'm just saying what's wrong. I don't even know what a "mock rescue" is. I'm trying to get a solution to a problem. I have spent several hours today trying to get it to work.
183147 Kathleen :  i just change the nick it oinvolves a long password
183152 Sueann :  I think that mc tries to put a temporary script there he want's to execute
183152 Felicia :  well you swirtched you twit, before i could tab complete you
183157 Kathleen :  15 chat=racters so thats why i dont changwe nick
183190 Darlena *  entered the room.
183196 Anastasia :  Alta: How do I find that out? I just specified the partitions as "RAID."
183207 Felicia :  Anastasia: i still don;t understand your dilemma i guess .. i scrolled back a bit .. but can you explain again what exactly you want to do?.. and tell us your Hardwrae and Kernel versions
183208 Mirella *  entered the room.
183219 Alta :  Anastasia: by running fdisk -l on the disk device names as just described.
183241 Alta :  Anastasia: it doesn't change anything, rather it will display a report
183243 Anastasia :  Felicia: I'm just trying to setup software RAID-1. I'm using the Feisty alternate CD.
183261 Felicia :  Kathleen: ok .. but you askede why i hit a wrong nick .. and explaining to you, b/c it's all your fault :-P
183286 Anastasia :  Alta: I'll just paraphrase it, since everytime I do something I have to get up and reconnect the monitor, KB, mouse.
183304 Felicia :  Anastasia: i don;t know ubuntu well at all .. but what's this "alternate" CD dealio about?
183307 Alta :  Anastasia: can't you use ssh?
183346 Anastasia :  Alta: I'm just a Linux Makeda. Plus this comp is not connected to the internet because I'm not in the server room.
183359 Felicia :  Anastasia: have you ever had Linux RAID working on that box?
183369 Alta :  Anastasia: ok; do I take it from that that you don't know what ssh is?
183376 Anastasia :  Alta: Georgia monitor broke in the server room, which I tried repairing for 2 hours...
183394 Alta :  Anastasia: you can get a terminal on another workstation if the ssh service is running (use putty on windows).
183395 Rosanne :  sounds like the data center i used to work in....
183423 Felicia :  time for some dave letterman tossing off the rockefeller center roof
183438 Anastasia :  Felicia: Georgia RAID is working. Problem is it doesn't boot off either HD by itself.
183455 Anastasia :  Felicia: In other words, it only boots when both HDs are present.
183455 Jose *  entered the room.
183460 Felicia :  Anastasia: is there a separate /boot partition?
183461 Rosanne :  Anastasia, you may just need to specify a different root= boot option, as was mentioned earlier.
183494 Anastasia :  Felicia: md0=Ext3 /; md1=swap; md2=Ex3 /boot
183497 Basilia *  left the room (quit: "leaving").
183507 Sueann *  left the room.
183509 Anastasia :  Rosanne: How should I do that?
183511 Shayna *  entered the room.
183516 Felicia :  you need to mirror that .. are these IDE, or Sata? or ..
183529 Anastasia :  Felicia: EIDE
183546 Rosanne :  when the grub menu comes up, hit "e" to edit it.  find the root=/dev/md0 and change it to say, root=/dev/hda1 or whatever device it is.
183555 Felicia :  those are md devices .. where's your partitions? .. your partitions make up 1 md0
183593 Anastasia :  Felicia: partitions are linked to md, equally sized.

183686 Tamisha *  entered the room.
183686 Felicia :  grub-install --root-directory=/boot /dev/md2 .. but you should've mirrored each of those before creating your md devices
183758 Felicia :  you shouldn't use ndo as a root drive entry IINM, but either a UUID partition (/dev/hda3, or whatever) .. i'm not sure now.. the way you have that setup
183776 Felicia :  er s/use ndo/use a md0
183807 Gia *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
183807 Felicia :  or root=LABEL=<labelname> ..
183815 Elli :  Nah, using a md0 entry as root drive entry is fine
183820 Jena *  entered the room.
183822 Rosanne :  i don't think there's a reason not to use md0 as a root drive
183837 Jena :  how do i tell grep to skip ./log when searching recursively?
183868 Felicia :  Rosanne: i'd have to look it up again .. but --> " es no my yob " ;-)
183904 Priscila :  Jena: use find.
183913 Felicia :  Jena: use find
183919 Felicia :  er gah
183932 Priscila :  0wn3d.
183946 Jodee *  entered the room.
183952 Nicki :  Jena: grep foo `find . \! -name "log"`

184049 Anastasia :  Rosanne, Alta, Felicia: I edited the boot to "sda2", but got the error msg: "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off" then "initramfs md:md0 stopped" then some lines with "stopped\bind md."

184125 Herschel *  entered the room.
184126 Glennie :  I have a beige G3 Macintosh running Yellowdog 3.1 and Quinton 2.4.33, I'm trying to get the printer working, it's attached t the printer serial port and it's a color style writer 4500.  I want to know what the serial settings should be and what printer .ppd I should use (i suspect the HP one[s] because it's basically Spencer apple branded hp deskjet).
184167 Alta :  Anastasia: I don't know then, sorry. it works fine on my system but I'm using a pretty lightweight distro and no initrd or anything like that.
184221 Anastasia :  I don't understand why RAID is not developed in Ubuntu.
184230 Kary *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
184231 Elli :  It should be...
184247 Jena :  path can be a pattern! sweet
184248 Elli :  But the combination of hardware might, for whatever reason, give it problems
184253 Anastasia :  I'm switching to Windows.
184291 Anastasia :  I've considered it seriously, I think it's the right decision for me. Please don't be offended by what I said.
184295 Maxwell :  shame on you
184299 Sheila *  left the room (quit: "Konversation terminated!").
184305 Silvia *  is DEEPLY offended
184311 Anastasia :  Maxwell: How else could I get RAID working then?
184314 Elli :  Anastasia, considering your problems I understand
184317 Crista *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
184317 Rosanne :  Anastasia, might be a good idea.  linux software raid isn't all that hard to set up, but recovery can get really complicated.
184323 Priscila :  I am going to go out and beat up children, i'm that offended.
184329 Maxwell :  Anastasia: use the Force!
184341 Crista *  entered the room.
184345 Anastasia :  I mean, I really like using Linux for the desktop, but not for the server.
184353 Andrea *  entered the room.
184360 Elli :  Anastasia, that is kind of backwards =P
184361 Alta :  Anastasia: funny, I find the reverse is applicable ;)
184362 Evon *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
184374 Maegan *  left the room (quit: "I'm leaving.").
184375 Alta :  Anastasia: btw, are you not able to get access to the console atm? you haven't actually run any of the tests that I suggested.
184376 Anastasia :  I have Spencer idea...Does Linux have clustering support such as in Windows 2003?
184377 Felicia :  if you installed grub to MBR on each disk separately in the 1st place you wouldn't have this issue .. it's likely your root (hd0,1) entries .. yes the setup can be a bit awkward, but once you know it ..you know it inside and out .. i told you what to read for rootonraid -- it's installed with the md pkg
184381 Glennie :  Anybody familiar with linux on a macintosh?
184400 Glennie :  Anastasia - Yes
184434 Anastasia :  Alta: (sigh) fine... Now I have to get up, reconnect all the cables, change boot options, and rewrite them on paper...
184440 Glennie :  Though such support is more a function of the installed apps and interface than it is the OS itself.

184550 Kimberely *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
184563 Anastasia :  Alta: But that's no problem to me, I've done that for ~15 times already today. So I should run "sudo fdisk -l" and what else?
184576 Kimberely *  entered the room.
184608 Alta :  Anastasia: can I ask one thing ... are both disks in perfect working order, only you're just testing what happens when a disk is unavailable?
184617 Alta :  Anastasia: or has there been some corruption/malfunction?
184618 Anastasia :  omg a *WHOLE* day wasted on RAID. I must have gone crazy.
184637 Elli :  I wasted much more then that getting my first raid working
184642 Elli :  But then again I'm blonde so that's okay =D
184648 Craig *  entered the room.
184658 Anastasia :  Alta: I power down the computer, disconnect the HD, and change the jumper on the other one so BIOS could recognize it.
184661 Voncile *  left the room (quit: "This computer has gone to sleep").

184677 Alta :  Anastasia: ok
184704 Hassan *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
184712 Anastasia :  Alta: So should I run fdisk -l?
184714 Jacklyn :  Ok, this is probably a stupid question. How do I copy the entire contents of a directory, dir1, into a directory dir2?
184715 Cecilia *  entered the room.
184728 Maegan *  entered the room.
184729 Craig :  man dir
184732 Rocco *  entered the room.
184736 Ramona *  entered the room.
184736 Craig :  man cp =)
184736 Alta :  Anastasia: sure. it's just a simple test to check that the partition type is set correctly on any partitions that are used as part of Spencer array.
184741 Cecilia *  left the room.
184745 Alta :  Anastasia: what are the devices that you're using ... sda and sdb?
184752 Craig :  Jacklyn: man cp, and look at -r
184760 Kathey *  entered the room.
184764 Maegan :  Hey I'm having a problem with Wine, for some reason none of my Wine apps have Spencer internet connection, any idea what might cause it? I'm running Wine in Kubuntu.
184765 Jacklyn :  Craig: I did. I do not believe I can do exactly what I want to do with the cp command alone.
184765 Regine *  draws a loch of hair from blondie
184778 Alina *  entered the room.
184782 Craig :  Jacklyn: you can
184804 Craig :  cp -r dir1/ dir2      or  cp -r dir1/* dir2/
184828 Jacklyn :  Craig: Georgia first one will put a copy of dir1 into dir 2. Georgia second one will not get .* named files.
184850 Alta :  Anastasia: if you can, run "/etc/init.d/sshd start" so that you can sit comfortably at another station and operate the system (as mentioned before, you can use "putty" on windows).
184852 Tam *  entered the room.
184856 Rosanne :  Jacklyn, cd dir1; tar -cpf - . | tar -xpf - -C /path/to/dir2/
184857 Elli :  Felicia, hands off mister, I had it fixed for partying just Spencer hour ago
184858 Felicia *  left the room (quit: "using sirc version 2.211+KSIRC/1.3.12").
184882 Jacklyn :  Rosanne: Woa, are you serious? Is this the only way? Wow.
184885 Craig :  Jacklyn: no. you're wrong. rtfm
184893 Rosanne :  Jacklyn, there are many ways.
184900 Rosanne :  grasshopper
184916 Rosanne :  you could use rsync also
184922 Jacklyn :  Craig: Which one is wrong, the first point or the second?
184927 Elli :  Jacklyn, `cp -av /dir1 /dir2`
184931 Lajuana :  Jacklyn: rsync is your tiny god
184937 Jacklyn :  Rosanne: Yea, I think I might go the rsync route.
184945 Jeane *  entered the room.
184950 Jacklyn :  I thought cp could do it.
184952 Alta :  cp -a works fine
184957 Craig :  you are seriously using rsync to copy one dir to another. dear jeebus
184965 Jeane :  hello, how can I set my computer a X server?

185172 Elli :  Jacklyn, bre creative :)
185176 Elli :  s/bre/be
185186 Jacklyn :  Yea, I will. I'll use rsync.
185192 Elli :  Hehe
185210 Alta :  Jacklyn: what is it that you're trying to do? just clone the directory?
185220 Jacklyn :  I think either that or some find command to list all of the files in the directory.
185239 Trudy *  left the room (quit: ).
185240 Elli :  cp -av /dir1/* /dir2
185242 Elli :  Sounds good to me
185243 Jacklyn :  Alta: No, I need to copy the contents of one directory into another, overwriting what might be there.
185250 Alta :  Jacklyn: ah, I see
185256 Jacklyn :  Rita: But that will not get files that start with a dot.
185263 Evon *  entered the room.
185272 Arlen *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

185273 Romelia *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
185277 Nicki :  ;)
185280 Jacklyn :  I can do it with rsync, but I was wondering if there was Spencer easier method.
185300 Ron *  left the room (quit: Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)).
185309 Jacklyn :  Nicki: But I don't want to loose the files that are already in dir2 that are not in dir1.
185312 Lajuana :  Jacklyn: find | xargs stuff, probably, but rsync is easier.
185317 Rosanne :  rsync is pretty easy already
185351 Jacklyn :  Rosanne: True, but I've always thought of rsync as the 50lb sledge hammer for killing a fly. I think my perception is a bit misplaced.
185352 Lajuana :  Yeah. rsync -avv --progress foo/ bar/ and you're done.
185362 Anastasia :  Alta: http://sial.org/pbot/25140 I got errors-invalid partition table.
185362 Nicki :  Jacklyn: ah, well, rsync won't do that either, it will remove removed files. if you want to keep track of changes, you could use rdiff-abckup, it makes a copy and also makes a spcial dir with reverse patches to obtain any past versions of files
185371 Lajuana :  Nicki: no it won't.
185374 Jacklyn :  Nicki: --keep I think.
185378 Lajuana :  It will remove removed files only if you use --delete
185385 Moira *  entered the room.
185388 Lajuana :  Otherwise, files that exist in target but not in source are ignored.
185391 Desire *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
185393 Jacklyn :  Or yea what Lajuana said.
185399 Nicki :  ah, well, rdiff-backup is still better, since you can retrieve versiosn of files from specific days, :0
185413 Hye *  left the room (quit: "Konversation terminated!").
185422 Moira *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
185425 Nicki :  and rdiff only sends parts of files that are different, rsync resends whoel file if part is changed
185425 Lajuana :  Nicki: I think the point here is just to merge the directories.
185426 Jodee *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
185430 Lajuana :  Not to make versioned backups.
185436 Lajuana :  And, no, rsync only sends parts.
185442 Alta :  Anastasia: ok, that all looks fine. when the Quinton boots it looks for partitions that are of type FD and have a RAID "superblock" then tries to assemble them automatically. I wanted to make sure it was the case.
185446 Lajuana :  Read the man page and/or test it yourself.
185462 Jacklyn :  Ok, I don't want to start a flame war.
185463 Nicki :  eh, but that's why rdiff was created, because rsyn didn't have that ability.
185472 Alysa *  left the room (quit: "took the red pill...").
185482 Lajuana :  It shows it processing the entire file if you have --progress turned on, but that's checksum, not necessarily transfer.
185483 Ocie *  left the room (quit: "Ex-Chat").
185484 Alta :  Anastasia: next question. in grub, what setting do you have for root (e.g. root (hd0,0))?
185498 Lajuana :  Right, but if all you're doing is _copying a directory_ you don't want rdiff.
185501 Beatriz *  entered the room.
185509 Anastasia :  Alta: But it said that /dev/md* contains Spencer invalid partition table.
185523 Gladys *  left the room (quit: ).
185527 Tonita :  anyone know if it's possible to get clamscan or clamdscan to use a remote machine to do the scanning?
185540 Alta :  Anastasia: md* shouldn't contain a partition table. it's just a block device aggregated from two partitions (across sda and sdb). and that block device has a filesystem on it (no partition table).
185565 Alta :  Anastasia: if you think about it, combining two genuine partitions into a RAID array, then creating a partition table on that array would be a bit weird ...
185572 Anastasia :  Alta: I was about to ask a question about that. It booted md0 (the root partition) but my /boot partition is md2-should I change it?
185578 Alta :  Anastasia: (there's LVM for that sort of thing)
185617 Alta :  Anastasia: ok, let's get everything clear. could you paste /etc/fstab and /proc/mdstat? that would give me some useful info without having to ask lots of questions.

186426 Alta :  Anastasia: Hmm, I honestly can't see any problems with that for the test procedure that you're using. one potential point of weakness is the "root (hd0,2)" in menu.lst. that would fail if sda3 became corrupted (you'd need to tell grub to look for its files in (hd1,2) instead.
186436 Alta :  Anastasia: but that's not relevant right now because you're unplugging a disk completely ;)
186448 Alta :  Anastasia: so the reamaining disk is the first one detected by the BIOS so grub is OK there.
186486 Alta :  Anastasia: the Quinton _should_ simply detect the 3 viable partitions on the remaining disk and construct the 3 arrays (running in degraded mode).
186547 Thaddeus *  left the room.
186561 Raymond *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
186569 Anastasia :  Alta: But it's not...
186573 Alta :  Anastasia: my very tentative guess is that maybe the initrd image used in ubuntu is buggy. Spencer initrd image contains a filesystem which is mounted and used by the Quinton for initialisation before the "real" root filesystem is later mounted.
186586 Raymond *  entered the room.
186631 Katelynn *  left the room (quit: ""[]s"").
186640 Alta :  Anastasia: I don't use initrd at all, which is Spencer obvious difference. I emphasise the word "tentative" though. I only wish I could issue a more definitive suggestion.
186665 Alta :  Anastasia: the RAID layer in the Quinton is very good and perfectly capable of it, I know that much.
186666 Anastasia :  Alta: I checked the CRC and CD for errors. What distro do you use?
186679 Alta :  Anastasia: gentoo (it's DIY all the way there)
186729 Anastasia :  Alta: Is it easy to recover\partition RAID in Gentoo?
186738 Alta :  Anastasia: this is my opinion, for what it's worth: because the Quinton is capable of doing what you are expecting it to do, it seems reasonable to assume that the way your distro works is getting in the way of doing it.
186741 Forrest :  yall ever heard of a mother-in-law plan?
186742 Ramonita *  entered the room.
186765 Alta :  Anastasia: because of that, you might be better off going through ubuntu-specific support channels, where there are people who have better knowledge (about the distro).
186766 Beatriz :  Er, while we're on the topic... how much "worse" does software-RAID perform than hardware-RAID?
186783 Anastasia :  Alta: They had no clue.

187142 Gale :  Yuriko: is that a trick question?
187143 Anastasia :  Nada: I'm a Makeda.
187150 Alta :  Anastasia: Im loathe to recommend Spencer alternate distro because I think the problem can be solved right where you are. I just don't have Spencer exact answer for you atm. :(
187152 Nada :  get another then
187158 Nada :  gentoo will scare ya
187161 Nada :  it scared me, so yea.
187165 Anastasia :  centOS?
187174 Kraig *  left the room (quit: "++").
187177 Anastasia :  I know debian\netBSD is complex.
187179 Nada :  centos is aight, but i never really used it

187183 Nada :  debian is quite easy actually
187185 Delpha *  entered the room.
187194 Gale :  if you're good at reading and following directions, you should be fine

187201 Nada :  lots of docs out there for debian
187210 Julio *  entered the room.
187212 Yuriko :  gentoo is better...
187214 Nada :  unless ya installing it on a laptop, wanna get some crazy wireless running or bluetooth or whatever new stuff
187232 Nada :  then it gets complicated. but it's the same for any distro if i ain't wrong
187236 Anastasia :  Gale, Nada: So I don't have to spend hours trying to recover RAID?

187383 Brant *  entered the room.
187384 Anastasia :  Alta: Also, doesn't Debian use up a lot of HD space? I only have 10GB.
187396 Gale :  Anastasia: no
187407 Alta :  Anastasia: not at all. you can install miniscule debian installations.
187407 Gale :  Anastasia: it just comes down to what you install
187411 Nada :  heck no
187419 Nada :  the core of debian is less than 2g
187422 Chanel *  entered the room.
187423 Gale :  if anything, Debian tends to be less bloated than most
187425 Yuriko *  left the room ("Leaving").
187429 Chanel :  is there some program that can talk to GTalk ?
187434 Nada :  much less than 2g IIRC
187434 Chanel :  (for linux of course)
187437 Hoa :  GTalkTalk?  ;)
187444 Alta :  Anastasia: if you're asking me whether I'd trust debian over ubuntu then, personally, I would have to say "absolutely"
187447 Chanel :  Hoa: seriously?

187504 Nada :  even skype is quite unstable :/
187512 Alta :  Anastasia: I can't tell you whether everything is going to work as expected. I'm a gentoo man who dabbles with debian occasionally. if I could promise you that you problem would be solved simply by using another distro, I would have said so. sorry I can't be of more help.
187512 Chanel :  Nada: Ekiga?
187513 Carly :  slow = fast
187518 Carly :  war = peace
187519 Nada :  ekiga?

187532 Nada :  ah, dunno it
187533 Chanel :  Nada: yeah, ekiga softphone, it is using SIP protocol
187535 Alta :  Anastasia: but I'm holding on to my theory that the init scripts or initrd in ubuntu are below par.
187544 Roselia *  entered the room.
187553 Nada :  Chanel, can i connect to skype users using ekiga?
187563 Anastasia :  Alta: Well thanks very much for your help! I'll try Debian.
187565 Chanel :  Nada: I think not, it is a different protocol
187568 Nada :  ah i see
187578 Ward *  is noob in that area

187601 Nada :  too much perl for the day
187632 Nada :  at least i got done with most of what i want, except for one thing. :(
187644 Alta :  Anastasia: whatever, the problem is, I suspect it's in initramfs-tools (which prepares the initrd that is critical to the distro's behaviour before it gets a chance to mount the root filesystem)
