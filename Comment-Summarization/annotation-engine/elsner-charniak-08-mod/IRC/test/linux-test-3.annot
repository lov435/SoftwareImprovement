T29 18386 Arlie :  Lai, if you ever get a computer and an isp again, by all means, setup a website and start selling vitamins or something ... you have the skills to do it, you just keep thinking you dont need money
T29 18399 Lai :  lol remind me of that one
T29 18408 Azzie :  Lai: You do need a bank account, but there shouldnt be any reason you couldnt have one?
T29 18419 Arlie :  selling vitamins is a worthy profession ... people need vitamins

T29 18498 Lai :  i still think a $15 or $20 debit cards would be a better idear
T46 18504 Delmar :  has anyone used pcb ?
T29 18509 Lai :  Angla: be well
T29 18523 Arlie :  Azzie, yes, even a simple checking account requires that you didnt screw up your last checking account, which is easy to do if you have no money

T29 18574 Lai :  i give you the mailing address of where to send them- to the manager of property
T45 18574 Josephina :  Gigi: no relationship, they do the same sort of thing, but are different in several ways. I recommend mingw+msys but have used cygwin and got no problem with it

T50 18675 Alisa :  Lashawna: as a 16 year old Junior also lusting for a job at google, I think you've got better chances than I, at very least.
T50 18681 Mirta :  Hey - dude - I like got a job interview tomorrow finally.
T50 18691 Lai :  cool
T51 18701 Josephina :  Ricardo: I thought com port was serial
T51 18707 Alisa :  Ricardo: nothing too important...just celebrating the return of Lai :`)
T50 18708 Lashawna :  Mirta, but how old r u
T50 18717 Mirta :  34
T50 18719 Lashawna :  Mirta, and do you have a degree?
T50 18721 Arlie :  sure, work at google, just dont take stock options in leiu of salary
T50 18724 Lai :  heh
T50 18726 Mirta :  2 years.
T50 18741 Azzie :  Lashawna: Im a 19 year old coder who has been coding sine at least 10 and am in the same position.
T50 18746 Arlie :  at $460 a share for a company that has yet to make $1 in profit ... its not a good deal
T50 18755 Lai :  heh
T51 18758 Ricardo :  Josephina: you know, I think you're right, but it doesn't matter for what I'm trying to do, but it is serial, I'm just retarded lol
T29 18768 Lai :  ok, so where are we on the relif?
T-1 18771 Sara *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
T50 18774 Azzie :  Lashawna: The key with that company is to do get a good degree and do something big in school.
T51 18776 Josephina :  Ricardo: hehe ok
T50 18778 Azzie :  from what i hear..
T29 18779 Lai :  should i post a mialing address to send it to?
T29 18786 Alisa :  !seen Kacy
T29 18795 Lai :  this would be a one shot thing tho cuz i cant rejoin later to remind
T50 18796 Nicki :  Lashawna: Here's a hint.  Don't go around telling people you've been programming since 10.  (yes, I know it's likely literally true.  But it shows immaturity to claim it the same way professional programmers cite their years of experience.))
T-1 18799 Malcom *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
T51 18801 Josephina :  Ricardo: and linux doesn't call it a com port, it's called a serial tty or something
T50 18806 Mirta :  Lashawna - who are you and why does it matter so much? People who know me know that this is a step forward.
T50 18837 Lashawna :  I'm just tired of working for myself
T-1 18839 Shayna *  entered the room.
T29 18842 Alisa :  Lai: yeah. Post it. I'll see if we can get Kacy to put it in the /topic :)))
T50 18843 Arlie :  Lashawna, no, screw that, if your good, let everyone know it, except your co-workers
T51 18845 Josephina :  Ricardo: and how to make a program think it's receiving data from it, would depend on how the program is receiving data from it
T51 18846 Ricardo :  Josephina: ah thanks for the heads up
T29 18847 Felicia :  Lai: sure . can't hurt .. or open a temp new channel and let everyone interested join .. then take it from there
T-1 18861 Laraine *  entered the room.
T51 18865 Ricardo :  Josephina: yeah, it's using some library to do it, guess I need to figure out how that library works
T29 18866 Felicia :  Lai: open a channel called #Lai ;-)
T50 18866 Lashawna :  Arlie, my brother told me that one?
T51 18872 Josephina :  Ricardo: ah ok
T29 18874 Lai :  ok; but someone else is gonna have to remind others
T29 18889 Felicia :  Lai: oh .. whatever then
T29 18889 Azzie :  Someone make a quizrelief bot
T-1 18894 Alice *  entered the room.
T50 18895 Arlie :  Lashawna, co-workers are evil ... they'll screw you up if your good enough to make them look bad .... they operate based on fear
T53 18899 Mirta :  hello Azzie
T50 18900 Ricardo :  I am half way done with a 4 year degree and working with a company designing software for night vision cameras, co-op programs rock
T-1 18901 Mable *  entered the room.
T50 18908 Lai :  what whatever?
T51 18908 Lai :  huh?
T50 18909 Nicki :  Arlie: only at crappy places. :)
T53 18911 Azzie :  Ricardo: Hello there, how is it going?
T50 18919 Arlie :  Nicki, it happens everywhere
T29 18922 Felicia :  Lai: i figured to keep it a bit erm private
T50 18927 Lashawna :  Arlie, that's interesting
T50 18928 Nicki :  Arlie: cynic. :)
T50 18931 Arlie :  Nicki, at least, anywhere were there is a gap in skill levels
T50 18938 Arlie :  its human nature
T53 18939 Ricardo :  Azzie: pretty good, just at the office, about to leave
T53 18943 Ricardo :  how are you?
T29 18954 Lai :  Felicia: ok i'm bumming here; fizzle
T29 18966 Felicia :  Lai: if everyone needs to mail to that address on their own then maybe it';s beetter you spm it and it get's spammed ;-P
T53 18970 Azzie :  Ricardo: Well, end of semester work, what could be better?
T-1 18973 Angelika *  left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
T50 18978 Nicki :  Arlie: well, I've never been "screwed up" by a junior programmer.  they come to me for help.
T51 18980 Josephina :  Ricardo: if it's just reading from /dev/ttyS0 or something you could somehow get it to just read from a named pipe instead
T50 18999 Arlie :  Nicki, no no no ... someone below you is not a co-worker, they are an underling
T29 19003 Lai :  Felicia:  ok then what?
T56 19006 Ricardo :  Azzie: I hate that crap... you in college?
T50 19007 Lashawna :  ok, so my chances with google are probably slim, does anyone know of a company in need of experienced html, css, jscript, perl, python, etc. programmers?
T50 19016 Nicki :  Arlie: the sr programmers come to me for help, also. :)
T50 19032 Lashawna :  Nicki, then you should get promoted
T51 19034 Ricardo :  Josephina: hmm yeah maybe you're right... I might just have to end up modifying the entire program
T50 19035 Arlie :  Nicki, yes, but them comming to you, and you making them look bad, are 2 different issues
T-1 19041 Katherin *  entered the room.
T29 19043 Felicia :  Lai: post the info .. atleast it'll be logged soemwhere then .. i didn't know what/who's address you were going to throw out

T51 19045 Ricardo :  just to read from a different input stream
T56 19055 Azzie :  Ricardo: Indeed, trying to decide if im going to keep putting up with this or just start coding for myself.
T55 19056 Tena :  hey, anyone know if theres any way i can play songs i bought on itunes in linux?
T-1 19061 Izetta *  entered the room.
T55 19074 Azzie :  Tena: No, and thats what you get for buying from ITunes.
T56 19078 Ricardo :  finish college at least, how many more years you have?
T29 19087 Lai :  Felicia: the address to -- you know what, i think it's not such a good idear
T56 19094 Azzie :  Ricardo: 3 at least.
T55 19097 Ricardo :  Tena: you just need to get the m4a/mp4 plugin
T-1 19098 Maegan *  left the room (quit: "I'm leaving.").
T29 19108 Felicia :  Lai: see.. ok .. think about it ..
T56 19111 Ricardo :  Azzie: you are a freshman this year and already tired of it?
T29 19114 Lai :  yea i am
T50 19117 Nicki :  Lashawna: I'm paid well.  I don't care about job titles.  and I enjoy troubleshooting for others. :)
T56 19124 Azzie :  Ricardo: I would rather be coding!
T-1 19129 Dagny *  entered the room.
T29 19134 Felicia :  Lai: or PM one of us .. or whatever ..
T56 19135 Ricardo :  Azzie: there is a lot of coding to be done in college lol
T29 19137 Lai :  crap
T29 19139 Arlie :  Lai, i feel for you, but im not sending you any money
T29 19144 Lai :  k
T50 19161 Alisa :  Lashawna: look on jobs.com, also jobs.perl.com.
T56 19163 Ricardo :  Azzie: get on some open source projects like KDE or gaim or gcc or something
T29 19164 Felicia :  so what .. that's just one monkey Q
T56 19165 Azzie :  Ricardo: Either that, or transfer to a school where I can find a teacher who is as interested in independent coding projects as I am.
T29 19184 Felicia :  there's many more of us apes about
T56 19189 Dorthy :  the interesting CS classes don't start until your junior/senior year, especially if you're already familiar with the languages being taught and basic data structure concepts
T29 19194 Arlie :  Felicia, hey man, i was homeless and noone sent me any money
T-1 19201 Horacio *  entered the room.
T56 19208 Ricardo :  Dorthy: true.. I am going into my third year, finally get to do AI and OS and compilers, etc
T56 19209 Azzie :  Ricardo: I'm trying, but the problem is that I have to spend far too much time on schoolwork, even though im paying 30k/year for it.
T29 19211 Lai :  Arlie: did you ask?
T-1 19212 Cornelius *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
T29 19215 Arlie :  Lai, no
T29 19223 Lai :  ok then
T58 19232 Dagny :  How can I discover which library file(s) contain an exported function name? I'm having a problem with linking against libpci.a and gzopen, and thinking another library may have declared the names
T56 19232 Azzie :  classic
T29 19234 Arlie :  Lai, if you have a truck load of stuff, why dont you sell it
T56 19250 Ricardo :  Azzie: hehe but it's only 3 more years... that's really short when you think abou tit.. I'd say just bear through it and get your degree, it's going to make it a lot easier to find a job and you'll get paid more
T29 19251 Lai :  i dont have access to my stuff atm
T29 19254 Arlie :  Lai, then when your out of stuff, find a south bound train and jump on it
T56 19260 Alisa :  Azzie: hah, the CS professors at the local university are A.) A man with a degree in parsing, not teaching CS, and B.)A woman who is a MAJOR microserf.
T58 19260 Nicki :  Dagny: strings and grep? ;)
T29 19269 Lai :  Arlie: yea or bus
T29 19270 Arlie :  Lai, wheres all your stuff ?
T29 19282 Lai :  Arlie: in the apt i was evicted from

T-1 19290 Daphne *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
T58 19290 Dagny :  Is that it? With having ldconfig I thought there must be a location for the list of exported functions
T59 19307 Ricardo :  Lai: why'd you get evicted? I missed the first half of this conversation
T-1 19316 Daphne *  entered the room.
T56 19323 Azzie :  Alisa: Luckilly at my school there are no microserfs :-).  We all have to do our coding with gcc.  The problem is most the profs just teach as a side job so they have their hands more than full.
T51 19329 Ricardo :  Josephina: lol I think it'd be much easier if I just modified the program....
T59 19334 Lai :  Ricardo: alledged non-payment of rent
T51 19336 Ricardo :  so I'm going to do taht
T-1 19337 Cedrick *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
T58 19341 Nicki :  Dagny: or grepping the source code or the documentation of the apis
T59 19347 Arlie :  Lai, you mean, payment of rent with junk bonds ?

T51 19431 Ricardo :  alright guys time for me to drive home, bbl
T58 19438 Dagny :  Nicki hmmm, i'll see if grep helps, source-code isn't an option for this
T-1 19445 Ricardo *  left the room.
T29 19446 Arlie :  Lai, and i commend you on the fact that your not like that, but because you live in a world constructed by people who are, you have to play by their rules at least enough to survive

T77 21113 Jesse :  Tatiana: doing it from a livecd is good IMHO, because the partition won't be written to while you back it up
T74 21115 Nicki :  I learned my money handling skills from playing MUDs, I save it up, then I spend it after I have it. :)
T74 21122 Madison :  Santo: i could get 5/10 jobs with no port or resume
