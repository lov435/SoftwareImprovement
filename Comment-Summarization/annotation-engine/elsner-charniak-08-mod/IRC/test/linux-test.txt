18330 Arlie :  its a federal reserve european banker tax man judge landlord conspiracy !
18337 Azzie :  Lai: I am certainly willing to help and send you what little money I can, but I'm sure A paypal would help a lot more.

18380 Lai :  Azzie:  i am truly grateful for the effort; but i cant see how i'd get the money out of paypal?
18386 Arlie :  Lai, if you ever get a computer and an isp again, by all means, setup a website and start selling vitamins or something ... you have the skills to do it, you just keep thinking you dont need money
18399 Lai :  lol remind me of that one
18408 Azzie :  Lai: You do need a bank account, but there shouldnt be any reason you couldnt have one?
18419 Arlie :  selling vitamins is a worthy profession ... people need vitamins

18498 Lai :  i still think a $15 or $20 debit cards would be a better idear
18504 Delmar :  has anyone used pcb ?
18509 Lai :  Angla: be well
18523 Arlie :  Azzie, yes, even a simple checking account requires that you didnt screw up your last checking account, which is easy to do if you have no money

18574 Lai :  i give you the mailing address of where to send them- to the manager of property
18574 Josephina :  Gigi: no relationship, they do the same sort of thing, but are different in several ways. I recommend mingw+msys but have used cygwin and got no problem with it
18577 Angelika :  that user is anybody???

18644 Mirta :  what's up sir?
18646 Lai :  Alisa: heh
18660 Arlie :  Lai, get busy designing a website to accept hurricane relief donations and pay yourself a percentage as a salary ... hurricane season is starting again

18669 Ricardo :  Alisa: hehe, what's up? I'm just here trying to figure out how the hell I can try to send commands into a program listening on the parallel com port
18675 Alisa :  Lashawna: as a 16 year old Junior also lusting for a job at google, I think you've got better chances than I, at very least.
18681 Mirta :  Hey - dude - I like got a job interview tomorrow finally.
18691 Lai :  cool
18701 Josephina :  Ricardo: I thought com port was serial
18707 Alisa :  Ricardo: nothing too important...just celebrating the return of Lai :`)
18708 Lashawna :  Mirta, but how old r u
18717 Mirta :  34
18719 Lashawna :  Mirta, and do you have a degree?
18721 Arlie :  sure, work at google, just dont take stock options in leiu of salary
18724 Lai :  heh
18726 Mirta :  2 years.
18741 Azzie :  Lashawna: Im a 19 year old coder who has been coding sine at least 10 and am in the same position.
18746 Arlie :  at $460 a share for a company that has yet to make $1 in profit ... its not a good deal
18755 Lai :  heh
18758 Ricardo :  Josephina: you know, I think you're right, but it doesn't matter for what I'm trying to do, but it is serial, I'm just retarded lol
18768 Lai :  ok, so where are we on the relif?
18771 Sara *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
18774 Azzie :  Lashawna: The key with that company is to do get a good degree and do something big in school.
18776 Josephina :  Ricardo: hehe ok
18778 Azzie :  from what i hear..
18779 Lai :  should i post a mialing address to send it to?
18786 Alisa :  !seen Kacy
18795 Lai :  this would be a one shot thing tho cuz i cant rejoin later to remind
18796 Nicki :  Lashawna: Here's a hint.  Don't go around telling people you've been programming since 10.  (yes, I know it's likely literally true.  But it shows immaturity to claim it the same way professional programmers cite their years of experience.))
18799 Malcom *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
18801 Josephina :  Ricardo: and linux doesn't call it a com port, it's called a serial tty or something
18806 Mirta :  Lashawna - who are you and why does it matter so much? People who know me know that this is a step forward.
18837 Lashawna :  I'm just tired of working for myself
18839 Shayna *  entered the room.
18842 Alisa :  Lai: yeah. Post it. I'll see if we can get Kacy to put it in the /topic :)))
18843 Arlie :  Lashawna, no, screw that, if your good, let everyone know it, except your co-workers
18845 Josephina :  Ricardo: and how to make a program think it's receiving data from it, would depend on how the program is receiving data from it
18846 Ricardo :  Josephina: ah thanks for the heads up
18847 Felicia :  Lai: sure . can't hurt .. or open a temp new channel and let everyone interested join .. then take it from there
18861 Laraine *  entered the room.
18865 Ricardo :  Josephina: yeah, it's using some library to do it, guess I need to figure out how that library works
18866 Felicia :  Lai: open a channel called #Lai ;-)
18866 Lashawna :  Arlie, my brother told me that one?
18872 Josephina :  Ricardo: ah ok
18874 Lai :  ok; but someone else is gonna have to remind others
18889 Felicia :  Lai: oh .. whatever then
18889 Azzie :  Someone make a quizrelief bot
18894 Alice *  entered the room.
18895 Arlie :  Lashawna, co-workers are evil ... they'll screw you up if your good enough to make them look bad .... they operate based on fear
18899 Mirta :  hello Azzie
18900 Ricardo :  I am half way done with a 4 year degree and working with a company designing software for night vision cameras, co-op programs rock
18901 Mable *  entered the room.
18908 Lai :  what whatever?
18908 Lai :  huh?
18909 Nicki :  Arlie: only at crappy places. :)
18911 Azzie :  Ricardo: Hello there, how is it going?
18919 Arlie :  Nicki, it happens everywhere
18922 Felicia :  Lai: i figured to keep it a bit erm private
18927 Lashawna :  Arlie, that's interesting
18928 Nicki :  Arlie: cynic. :)
18931 Arlie :  Nicki, at least, anywhere were there is a gap in skill levels
18938 Arlie :  its human nature
18939 Ricardo :  Azzie: pretty good, just at the office, about to leave
18943 Ricardo :  how are you?
18954 Lai :  Felicia: ok i'm bumming here; fizzle
18966 Felicia :  Lai: if everyone needs to mail to that address on their own then maybe it';s beetter you spm it and it get's spammed ;-P
18970 Azzie :  Ricardo: Well, end of semester work, what could be better?
18973 Angelika *  left the room ("Konversation terminated!").
18978 Nicki :  Arlie: well, I've never been "screwed up" by a junior programmer.  they come to me for help.
18980 Josephina :  Ricardo: if it's just reading from /dev/ttyS0 or something you could somehow get it to just read from a named pipe instead
18999 Arlie :  Nicki, no no no ... someone below you is not a co-worker, they are an underling
19003 Lai :  Felicia:  ok then what?
19006 Ricardo :  Azzie: I hate that crap... you in college?
19007 Lashawna :  ok, so my chances with google are probably slim, does anyone know of a company in need of experienced html, css, jscript, perl, python, etc. programmers?
19016 Nicki :  Arlie: the sr programmers come to me for help, also. :)
19032 Lashawna :  Nicki, then you should get promoted
19034 Ricardo :  Josephina: hmm yeah maybe you're right... I might just have to end up modifying the entire program
19035 Arlie :  Nicki, yes, but them comming to you, and you making them look bad, are 2 different issues
19041 Katherin *  entered the room.
19043 Felicia :  Lai: post the info .. atleast it'll be logged soemwhere then .. i didn't know what/who's address you were going to throw out

19044 Tena *  entered the room.
19045 Katherin *  left the room (quit: Excess Flood).
19045 Ricardo :  just to read from a different input stream
19055 Azzie :  Ricardo: Indeed, trying to decide if im going to keep putting up with this or just start coding for myself.
19056 Tena :  hey, anyone know if theres any way i can play songs i bought on itunes in linux?
19061 Izetta *  entered the room.
19074 Azzie :  Tena: No, and thats what you get for buying from ITunes.
19078 Ricardo :  finish college at least, how many more years you have?
19087 Lai :  Felicia: the address to -- you know what, i think it's not such a good idear
19094 Azzie :  Ricardo: 3 at least.
19097 Ricardo :  Tena: you just need to get the m4a/mp4 plugin
19098 Maegan *  left the room (quit: "I'm leaving.").

19117 Nicki :  Lashawna: I'm paid well.  I don't care about job titles.  and I enjoy troubleshooting for others. :)
19124 Azzie :  Ricardo: I would rather be coding!
19129 Dagny *  entered the room.
19134 Felicia :  Lai: or PM one of us .. or whatever ..
19135 Ricardo :  Azzie: there is a lot of coding to be done in college lol
19137 Lai :  crap
19139 Arlie :  Lai, i feel for you, but im not sending you any money
19144 Lai :  k
19161 Alisa :  Lashawna: look on jobs.com, also jobs.perl.com.
19163 Ricardo :  Azzie: get on some open source projects like KDE or gaim or gcc or something
19164 Felicia :  so what .. that's just one monkey Q
19165 Azzie :  Ricardo: Either that, or transfer to a school where I can find a teacher who is as interested in independent coding projects as I am.
19184 Felicia :  there's many more of us apes about
19189 Dorthy :  the interesting CS classes don't start until your junior/senior year, especially if you're already familiar with the languages being taught and basic data structure concepts
19194 Arlie :  Felicia, hey man, i was homeless and noone sent me any money
19201 Horacio *  entered the room.
19208 Ricardo :  Dorthy: true.. I am going into my third year, finally get to do AI and OS and compilers, etc
19209 Azzie :  Ricardo: I'm trying, but the problem is that I have to spend far too much time on schoolwork, even though im paying 30k/year for it.
19211 Lai :  Arlie: did you ask?
19212 Cornelius *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
19215 Arlie :  Lai, no
19223 Lai :  ok then
19232 Dagny :  How can I discover which library file(s) contain an exported function name? I'm having a problem with linking against libpci.a and gzopen, and thinking another library may have declared the names
19232 Azzie :  classic
19234 Arlie :  Lai, if you have a truck load of stuff, why dont you sell it
19250 Ricardo :  Azzie: hehe but it's only 3 more years... that's really short when you think abou tit.. I'd say just bear through it and get your degree, it's going to make it a lot easier to find a job and you'll get paid more
19251 Lai :  i dont have access to my stuff atm
19254 Arlie :  Lai, then when your out of stuff, find a south bound train and jump on it
19260 Alisa :  Azzie: hah, the CS professors at the local university are A.) A man with a degree in parsing, not teaching CS, and B.)A woman who is a MAJOR microserf.
19260 Nicki :  Dagny: strings and grep? ;)
19269 Lai :  Arlie: yea or bus
19270 Arlie :  Lai, wheres all your stuff ?
19282 Lai :  Arlie: in the apt i was evicted from

19290 Arlie :  Lai, go get it
19290 Daphne *  left the room (quit: Connection timed out).
19290 Dagny :  Is that it? With having ldconfig I thought there must be a location for the list of exported functions
19307 Ricardo :  Lai: why'd you get evicted? I missed the first half of this conversation
19316 Daphne *  entered the room.
19323 Azzie :  Alisa: Luckilly at my school there are no microserfs :-).  We all have to do our coding with gcc.  The problem is most the profs just teach as a side job so they have their hands more than full.
19329 Ricardo :  Josephina: lol I think it'd be much easier if I just modified the program....
19334 Lai :  Ricardo: alledged non-payment of rent
19336 Ricardo :  so I'm going to do taht
19337 Cedrick *  left the room (quit: Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
19341 Nicki :  Dagny: or grepping the source code or the documentation of the apis
19347 Arlie :  Lai, you mean, payment of rent with junk bonds ?

19445 Ricardo *  left the room.
19446 Arlie :  Lai, and i commend you on the fact that your not like that, but because you live in a world constructed by people who are, you have to play by their rules at least enough to survive
19452 Lai :  Felicia:
19458 Felicia :  yo yo

19477 Gene *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).

19531 Margery *  left the room (quit: "Konversation terminated!").
19535 Azzie :  Thats aweful, bust the door down.
19544 Velva :  If i link the two homes folders ie. ff & gg to xx, then I can log in as xx, but how can I choose which link to follow?
19545 Lai :  Nicki: i discharged the debt and sent a bond
19561 Felicia :  Lai: i mean the address that you can trust us to mail money to
